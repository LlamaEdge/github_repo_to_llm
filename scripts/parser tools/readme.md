# Parser Tools Documentation

This folder contains three Python scripts designed to parse different types of input data and generate a CSV file as output. Each script serves a unique purpose, as described below:

---

## 1. **Github_parser.py**

### Description:
The `Github_parser.py` script is used to clone a GitHub repository and create a CSV file containing the formatted contents of all files within the repository. It formats each file's content based on its file type for easier analysis and readability. The ```--exclude``` flag can be used to skip any specific folder from the repository. 

### Usage:
```bash
python github_parser.py /path/to/local/repo output.csv --exclude folder1 folder2
```

### Parameters:
- `<repo_url>`: The URL of the GitHub repository to be cloned and parsed.
- `<output_csv_path>`: The path where the generated CSV file will be saved.
- ```--exclude``` *Optional:* Folders to be excluded
---

## 2. **Local_parser.py**

### Description:
The `Local_parser.py` script is used to process a local folder (directory) and create a CSV file containing the formatted contents of all files within that folder. Similar to `Github_parser.py`, the script formats each file based on its type.

### Usage:
```bash
python python local_parser.py <repo_path> <output_path> --exclude folder1 folder2
```

### Parameters:
- `<local_path>`: The path to the local folder to be parsed.
- `<output_csv_path>`: The path where the generated CSV file will be saved.
- ```--exclude``` *Optional:* Folders to be excluded

## 3. **Repomix_parser.py**

### Description:
The `Repopack_parser.py` script is used to process a `.txt` file generated by the [Repomix Tool](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix). It parses the text file to extract file paths and their contents, formats them based on file type, and outputs the results in a CSV file.

### Usage:
```bash
python Repomix_parser.py <input_text_file> <output_csv_file>
```

### Parameters:
- `<input_text_file>`: The path to the `.txt` file generated by the Repomix Tool.
- `<output_csv_file>`: The path where the generated CSV file will be saved.

## Notes

1. Ensure you have read/write permissions for the specified file paths.
2. For `Github_parser.py`, ensure you have a valid internet connection to clone the repository.

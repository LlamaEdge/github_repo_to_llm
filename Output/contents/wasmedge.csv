.CurrentChangelog.md,"### 0.14.1-rc.5 (2024-09-13)

Features:

* Supported LLVM 17.0.6.
* Bumpped `spdlog` to `v1.13.0`.
* Bumpped `fmt` to `11.0.2`.
* Bumpped `simdjson` to `v3.10.0`.
* Bumpped `googletest` to `1.15.2`.
* [WASI-NN] ggml backend:
  * Bump llama.cpp to b3651.
  * Static link `libggml` and `libllama`.
  * Refined the CMake to support multiple backends of WASI-NN with ggml backend.
  * Supported compute single in RPC mode.
* [WASI-NN] Added support for whisper.cpp backend.
* [WASI-NN] Added support for piper backend.
* [WASI-NN] Added support for ChatTTS backend.
* [WASI-NN] Added support for Burn.rs backend.
  * Supported `squeezenet` and `whisper` models.
* [Plugin] Supported `wasmedge_stablediffusion` plug-in.
  * Enabled CUBLAS.
  * Enabled metal support on MacOS.
* [Plugin] Moved `wasi_logging` into built-in plug-in.
  * Instead of installing `wasi_logging` plug-in shared library, developers can find and get this plug-in after calling `WasmEdge_PluginLoadWithDefaultPaths()` API.
  * In the WasmEdge CLI tools, the built-in plug-ins will automatically be loaded.
* [Proposal] Initial support for instantiation phase of component model.
  * Due to the breaking change of API, bump the plug-in `API_VERSION` to `3`.
* [Proposal] Supported WASM Relaxed-SIMD proposal.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Proposal_RelaxSIMD` for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
  * Users can use the `--enable-relaxed-simd` to enable the proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed warnings on GCC-14.
* Fixed the `fmt` related header inclusion for error logging.
* Fixed WASI test error in Windows.
* Fixed version checking in source tarball.
* Fixed version detection issue when building from source.
* Fixed the visibility of internal symbols.
* [Loader] Fixed alignment checking in loading immediates for memory instructions.
* [Runtime] Fixed allocation issue when configured the limited memory page size.
* Used `fmt::format` instead of string stream in error logging.

Tests:

* Added WASI test suites on Windows.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on macOS platforms.
  * In the current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause a bus error during execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For a working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.

Thank all the contributors who made this release possible!

    # Periodic status check
    # 
    # GitVote allows checking the status of a vote in progress manually by
    # calling the /check-vote command. The periodic status check option makes
    # it possible to automate the execution of status checks periodically. The
    # vote status will be published to the corresponding issue or pull request,
    # the same way as if the /check-vote command would have been called
    # manually.
    #
    # When this option is enabled, while the vote is open, a status check will
    # be run automatically using the frequency configured. Please note that the
    # hard limit of one status check per day still applies, so if the command
    # has been called manually the automatic periodic run may be delayed.
    # Automatic status checks won't be run if the vote will be closed within
    # the next hour.
    #
    # Units supported:
    #
    #   - day / days
    #   - week / weeks
    #
    # As an example, using a value of ""5 days"" would mean that 5 days after the
    # vote was created, and every 5 days after that, an automatic status check
    # will be run.

    # periodic_status_check: ""5 days""
    #
    periodic_status_check: ""5 days""

    # Close on passing
    # 
    # By default, votes remain open for the configured duration. Sometimes,
    # specially on votes that stay open for a long time, it may be preferable
    # to close a vote automatically once the passing threshold has been met.
    # The close on passing feature makes this possible. Open votes where this
    # feature has been enabled will be checked once daily and, if GitVote
    # detects that the vote has passed, it will automatically close it.

  * Unified the preload options with case-insensitive matching
  * Introduce `metadata` for setting the ggml options.
    * The following options are supported:
      * `enable-log`: `true` to enable logging. (default: `false`)
      * `stream-stdout`: `true` to print the inferred tokens in the streaming mode to standard output. (default: `false`)
      * `ctx-size`: Set the context size the same as the `--ctx-size` parameter in llama.cpp. (default: `512`)
      * `n-predict`: Set the number of tokens to predict, the same as the `--n-predict` parameter in llama.cpp. (default: `512`)
      * `n-gpu-layers`: Set the number of layers to store in VRAM, the same as the `--n-gpu-layers` parameter in llama.cpp. (default: `0`)

This is a hotfix release.

Fixed issues:

* WASI:
  * fix rights of pre-open fd cannot write and fix read-only flag parse (#2458)
* WASI Socket:
  * Workaround: reduce the address family size for the old API
  * fix sock opt & add BINDTODEVICE (#2454)
* MacOS
  * Use OpenSSL 3.0 on MacOS when building the plugins.
  * Update the visibility of plugin functions.
  * Fix AOT Error on MacOS; fix #2427
    * Change enumerate attributes value to zero
    * Change import helper function to private linkage to hide symbols
    * Detect OS version

* Windows:
  * Fix missing msvcp140.dll issue (#2455)
  * Revert #2455 temporarily. Use `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` instead of `MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`.

Because the runwasi project supports both wasmtime and wasmedge, the wasmtime-fiber with different versions will make the compilation complex. To avoid this, we forked wasmtime-fiber as fiber-for-wasmedge.
  * Add a second phase mechanism to load plugins after the VM has already been built. (#2469)
* Documents:
  * Fix the naming of the AOT wasm file.
  * Add wasmedgec use cases for a slim container.
  * Add the Kwasm document.
  * Fix HostFunction with data example (#2441)

Known issues:

## インテグレーションと管理

WasmEdge とそれに含まれる wasm プログラムは、新規プロセスとして [CLI](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/running-with-wasmedge) から起動することも、既存プロセスから起動することもできます。既存のプロセス（例えば、実行中の [Go](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/go-sdk-for-embedding-wasmedge) や [Rust](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/rust-sdk-for-embedding-wasmedge) プログラムから起動した場合、WasmEdge は単に関数としてプロセス内で実行されます。現在のところ、WasmEdge はまだスレッドセーフではありません。独自のアプリケーションやクラウドネイティブフレームワークで WasmEdge を使用するには、以下のガイドを参照してください。

# Introduction

The WasmEdge Runtime provides a well-defined execution sandbox for its contained WebAssembly bytecode program. The runtime offers isolation and protection for operating system resources (e.g., file system, sockets, environment variables, processes) and memory space. The most important use case for WasmEdge is to safely execute user-defined or community-contributed code as plug-ins in a software product (e.g., SaaS, software-defined vehicles, edge nodes, or even blockchain nodes). It enables third-party developers, vendors, suppliers, and community members to extend and customize the software product. **[Learn more here](https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/users)**

## Features

WasmEdge can run standard WebAssembly bytecode programs compiled from C/C++, Rust, Swift, AssemblyScript, or Kotlin source code. It [runs JavaScript](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-javascript), including 3rd party ES6, CJS, and NPM modules, in a secure, fast, lightweight, portable, and containerized sandbox. It also supports mixing of those languages (e.g., to [use Rust to implement a JavaScript API](https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/javascript/rust)), the [Fetch](https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/javascript/networking#fetch-client) API, and [Server-side Rendering (SSR)](https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/javascript/ssr) functions on edge servers.

WasmEdge supports [all standard WebAssembly features and many proposed extensions](https://wasmedge.org/docs/start/wasmedge/extensions/proposals). It also supports a number of extensions tailored for cloud-native and edge computing uses (e.g., the [WasmEdge network sockets](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/socket-networking),[Postgres and MySQL-based database driver](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/database-drivers), and the [WasmEdge AI extension](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/ai-inference)).

## Integrations and management

WasmEdge and its contained wasm program can be started from the [CLI](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/running-with-wasmedge) as a new process, or from an existing process. If started from an existing process (e.g., from a running [Go](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/go-sdk-for-embedding-wasmedge) or [Rust](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/rust-sdk-for-embedding-wasmedge) program), WasmEdge will simply run inside the process as a function. Currently, WasmEdge is not yet thread-safe. In order to use WasmEdge in your own application or cloud-native frameworks, please refer to the guides below.

* [Embed WasmEdge into a host application](https://wasmedge.org/docs/embed/overview)
* [Orchestrate and manage WasmEdge instances using container tools](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/deploy-wasmedge-apps-in-kubernetes)
* [Run a WasmEdge app as a Dapr microservice](https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/rust/dapr)

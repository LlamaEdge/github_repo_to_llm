Thank you for contributing to GaiaNet's documentation!","Q: How can I fork the repository?
A: Forking the repository is a straightforward process. Here are the steps to follow:

**Step 1: Visit the GaiaNet docs repository on GitHub**

Go to the [GaiaNet docs repository](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs) on GitHub and click on the repository you want to fork.

**Step 2: Click the ""Fork"" button**

In the top-right corner of the repository page, you'll see a ""Fork"" button. Click on it.

**Step 3: Select where you want to fork the repository**

When you click the ""Fork"" button, GitHub will ask you to choose where you want to fork the repository. You can either fork it into your personal account or an organization that you manage. Choose the option that suits your needs.

That's it! Your forked repository is now live on your GitHub account.

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure you're logged in to your GitHub account before trying to fork a repository. If you're not logged in, GitHub will prompt you to log in before allowing you to fork the repository.

For example, let's say you're trying to contribute to an open-source project and you want to fork their documentation repository. You would follow these same steps:

1. Visit the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the ""Fork"" button.
3. Select where you want to fork the repository (your personal account or an organization).

By forking the repository, you're creating a copy of the original repository that you can modify and make changes to without affecting the original code. This is a fundamental concept in open-source development!"

Thank you for contributing to GaiaNet's documentation!","Q: Where should I select to fork the repository?
A: According to the documentation, you should select where you want to fork the repository (your personal account or an organization) in step 1 of contributing. This is a simple choice that allows you to choose whether you want to keep your changes separate from your own projects or collaborate with others.

**Bonus Tip:** Consider forking the repository into your personal account if you're unsure about the contribution, as it's easier to manage and review your changes in a single location. If you're working with a team or organization, consider forking the repository into their shared space to facilitate collaboration.

Example outside of the content: Imagine you're a student contributing to an open-source project on GitHub. You want to make some changes but don't want to affect your own projects. Forking the repository into your personal account allows you to keep your contributions separate from your academic work and other personal projects."

Thank you for contributing to GaiaNet's documentation!","Q: What do I need to create a new branch for my changes?
A: To create a new branch for your changes, you need to use the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

**Explanation:**

*   `git checkout`: This command is used to switch between different branches in your Git repository.
*   `-b`: The `-b` option tells Git to create a new branch. If you want to create a branch and then immediately switch to it, use the `-b` option followed by the name of the branch.

**Example:**

For instance, if you are working on a feature related to ""adding user authentication,"" your branch name could be `add-user-authentication`. Here's how you would create this branch:

```bash
git checkout -b add-user-authentication
```

This will create a new branch with the name `add-user-authentication` and switch you to that branch.

**Bonus Tip:**

To get out of your current branch and back into another branch, use `git checkout <branch-name>`. If you want to delete a branch after it has been merged (or if you want to delete an abandoned branch), use the following command:

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

This will permanently delete the branch from your local repository."

Thank you for contributing to GaiaNet's documentation!","Q: What is the first step after cloning the repository?
A: The first step after cloning the repository is to create a new branch for your changes. This can be done by running the following command:

```
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

This will create a new branch from your current commit, and you'll need to make your changes on this branch rather than modifying the main branch directly.

**Bonus Tip**: It's a good practice to give your feature branch a descriptive name that indicates what changes you're making. For example, if you're adding documentation for a new GaiaNet feature, you could create a branch named `add-gaianet-feature-docs`. This makes it easier to track and manage different branches in your project."

# Fine-tune LLMs

You could fine-tune an open-source LLM to

* Teach it to follow conversations.
* Teach it to respect and follow instructions.
* Make it refuse to answer certain questions.
* Give it a specific ""speaking"" style.
* Make it response in certain formats (e.g., JSON).
* Give it focus on a specific domain area.
* Teach it certain knowledge.

To do that, you need to create a set of question and answer pairs to show the model the prompt and the expected response.
Then, you can use a fine-tuning tool to perform the training and make the model respond the expected answer for
each question.
","Summary:
This text provides an overview of the process to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs). Fine-tuning LLMs involves modifying a pre-trained model to perform a specific task or set of tasks. The author suggests that fine-tuning can be used for various purposes, including:

1. Teaching the model to follow conversations and respect instructions.
2. Limiting the model's responses by refusing to answer certain questions.
3. Changing the model's speaking style.
4. Adjusting the format of its responses (e.g., JSON).
5. Focusing the model on a specific domain or area of knowledge.
6. Introducing new knowledge into the model.

To fine-tune an LLM, you need to create a set of training data consisting of question and answer pairs. These pairs should include:

* A prompt or question that is used as input
* The expected response from the model

Once you have this data, you can use a fine-tuning tool (e.g., a library or framework) to perform the training process. During fine-tuning, the model learns to generate responses for each question based on the provided examples."

","Q: What could you fine-tune an open-source LLM to do?
A: Fine-tuning an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) is a powerful technique to tailor the model's capabilities to specific tasks or requirements. Here are some examples of what you could fine-tune an LLM to do:

1. **Teach it to follow conversations**: You can create a dataset of conversation flows, where the model learns to respond cohesively and maintain context throughout the dialogue.
2. **Teach it to respect and follow instructions**: Provide the model with examples of how to follow specific instructions or commands, such as ""Write a story about..."", ""Summarize this text"", or ""Provide definitions for these terms"".
3. **Make it refuse to answer certain questions**: Create a dataset where the model learns to recognize sensitive or off-topic questions and responds with something like ""I'm not comfortable answering that"" or ""That's outside my expertise"".
4. **Give it a specific 'speaking' style**: Fine-tune the model to adopt a particular tone, vocabulary, or language usage, such as formal, informal, humorous, or serious.
5. **Make it respond in certain formats (e.g., JSON)**: Teach the model to generate responses in specific formats, like JSON, XML, or CSV, to accommodate different application requirements.
6. **Give it focus on a specific domain area**: Specialize the model in a particular field, such as medicine, law, finance, or science, by providing it with relevant datasets and training examples.
7. **Teach it certain knowledge**: Supplement the model's existing knowledge with new information, facts, or concepts, making it more accurate and comprehensive in specific areas.

**Bonus Tip:** When fine-tuning an LLM, it's essential to ensure that your dataset is diverse, representative, and well-annotated. This will help the model learn generalizable patterns and avoid overfitting to a particular subset of data. Consider using techniques like data augmentation or active learning to enrich your dataset and improve the model's performance."

Then, you can use a fine-tuning tool to perform the training and make the model respond the expected answer for
each question.
","Q: What does option 1 allow you to do?
A: Option 1, ""Teach it to follow conversations,"" allows you to fine-tune the LLM to understand the context and flow of a conversation. This means that the model will be able to:

* Understand the question or topic being discussed
* Recall previous questions or statements in the conversation
* Respond coherently and relevantly to each question, taking into account the conversation history

By fine-tuning the LLM for conversation following, you can create a more engaging and interactive conversational interface. For example, a chatbot that uses this technique could have a natural-sounding dialogue with users.

**Bonus Tip:** To train an LLM to follow conversations effectively, it's essential to create a large dataset of conversation pairs (prompt and expected response). Additionally, you may want to experiment with different fine-tuning techniques, such as using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning methods.

For example, consider training a chatbot for customer support. The model could be asked to respond to user queries in the style of a helpful human assistant, while also respecting any context or history established in previous interactions. This would require a dataset with various conversation scenarios and corresponding responses.

Example: A customer calls to inquire about their account balance:
""Hi, I'd like to check my current balance.""
The fine-tuned LLM responds: ""Your current balance is $1234.40. Would you like me to assist you in transferring funds or making a payment?""

By following conversations effectively, the chatbot can provide a more personalized and empathetic user experience."

Then, you can use a fine-tuning tool to perform the training and make the model respond the expected answer for
each question.
","Q: What does option 2 allow you to do?
A: Option 2, ""Teach it to respect and follow instructions,"" allows you to fine-tune a LLM (Large Language Model) so that it can better understand and respond to user input in the way that is intended.

By creating a set of question and answer pairs where the model is taught to follow certain instructions or commands, you can train the model to:

* Understand and execute specific tasks
* Respond to complex queries with precision
* Adhere to specific formatting guidelines (e.g., grammar, syntax)
* Display more polite language

For example, if you create a training dataset that includes examples of users asking for help with a task and providing step-by-step instructions on how to complete it, the LLM can learn to understand the structure and content of these prompts. This allows it to generate more accurate responses that respect the original intent behind the user's input.

**Bonus Tip:** When fine-tuning your model to follow instructions, make sure to create a diverse set of training examples that cover different scenarios and edge cases. This will help ensure that the model can generalize its understanding of instruction-following beyond just a few specific prompts."

","Q: What does option 3 allow you to do?
A: Option 3, ""Make it refuse to answer certain questions"", allows you to fine-tune the LLM to prevent it from responding to specific questions or topics that you deem sensitive or off-limits.

For instance, imagine you're creating a chatbot for a children's website, and you want to avoid discussing mature themes like violence or substance abuse. By providing the model with examples of such questions along with a response indicating refusal to answer (e.g., ""I'm not allowed to discuss that topic""), you can teach the LLM to recognize and politely decline answering those types of queries.

Here's an example:

**Training data:**

* Question: ""What is the effect of smoking on health?""
* Response: ""I'm not allowed to discuss that topic. Let's talk about something else!""

By fine-tuning the model with such data, it will learn to recognize questions related to sensitive topics and respond accordingly.

**Bonus tip:** When creating training data for this type of feature, be sure to include a variety of examples that cover different scenarios and nuances, so the model can generalize and respond effectively in various contexts."

","Q: What does option 4 allow you to do?
A: Option 4, ""Give it a specific 'speaking' style,"" allows you to fine-tune the language model (LLM) to adopt a particular tone, voice, or linguistic characteristics when responding. This means that the LLM can be trained to respond in a way that mimics a certain personality, dialect, or writing style.

For example, if you wanted to give your LLM a more formal and professional tone, you could fine-tune it to use more complex sentences, technical vocabulary, and avoid colloquial expressions. On the other hand, if you want your LLM to sound more playful and humorous, you can train it to use puns, sarcasm, and a more relaxed language.

To do this, you would need to create a dataset of question and answer pairs that reflect the desired speaking style. The fine-tuning tool would then adjust the model's parameters to match this style, so that when it responds to new questions, it will adopt the specified tone and voice.

**Bonus tip:** To give your LLM a specific speaking style, you can use a technique called ""language masking"" where you mask certain words or phrases in the training data with a placeholder token. Then, during fine-tuning, you would provide the model with a set of replacement words or phrases that match the desired style. This allows the model to learn a mapping between the masked tokens and the specific linguistic characteristics you want it to adopt."

","Q: What is an example of a format that option 5 allows?
A: Option 5 allows you to make the LLM respond in a specific format, for example:

Instead of responding with a plain text answer like ""The capital of France is Paris."", you could fine-tune the model to respond in JSON format like this:
```
{
  ""answer"": ""Paris"",
  ""confidence"": 0.95,
  ""source"": ""Wikipedia""
}
```

This would allow your LLM to provide not only the answer, but also additional metadata such as confidence scores and sources.

**Bonus tip:** You can take it a step further by fine-tuning the model to respond in even more specific formats, such as CSV or Markdown. The possibilities are endless!

For example, if you're building an FAQ system for a product support website, you could have the LLM respond with answers in the following format:
```
Q: How do I reset my password?
A: Please go to the login page and click on ""Forgot Password"" below the username field.
```

This would allow your users to easily browse through questions and answers."

","Q: What is required to fine-tune an open-source LLM?
A: To fine-tune an open-source LLM, you will need to follow these steps:

1.  **Select a fine-tuning tool**: Choose a suitable tool for fine-tuning your LLM. Some popular options include Hugging Face's Transformers library, Google Colab, or DeepLearning.ai.
2.  **Prepare the data**: Gather a set of question and answer pairs that you want the model to learn from. This dataset should be relevant to the specific task you want the model to perform (e.g., conversation following, instruction adherence, etc.).
3.  **Create a training script**: Write a Python script using your chosen fine-tuning tool to load the pre-trained LLM and the prepared data. You will also need to specify the model's configuration parameters (such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs) and the desired output format for each response.
4.  **Fine-tune the model**: Run the training script to perform the fine-tuning process. The tool will adjust the pre-trained LLM's weights based on your provided data to adapt it to your specific task.

**Bonus Tip:** To avoid overfitting, ensure that your dataset is diverse and representative of the desired outcomes. Also, consider using techniques such as cross-validation or regularization to prevent overreliance on any single data point.

**Example:**

Suppose we want to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to answer questions about a specific domain area (e.g., astronomy). We create a dataset with relevant question and answer pairs:

| Questions                                 | Expected Responses                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| What is the largest planet in our solar system?   | Jupiter                             |
| Which star has a mass 100 times greater than the sun?    | VY Canis Majoris                     |
| What is the process by which stars die?       | Supernova                            |

We then use Hugging Face's Transformers library to fine-tune our pre-trained LLM on this dataset, specifying parameters such as batch size and learning rate. After running the training script, we can evaluate the model's performance on unseen data from the same domain area.

Remember that fine-tuning a LLM is an iterative process, and you may need to make adjustments to your approach based on the results of each iteration."

# llama.cpp

The popular llama.cpp tool comes with a `finetune` utility. It works well on CPUs! This fine-tune guide is reproduced with 
permission from Tony Yuan's [Finetune an open-source LLM for the chemistry subject](https://github.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/tree/main/fine-tune-model) project.

## Build the fine-tune utility from llama.cpp

The `finetune` utility in llama.cpp can work with quantized GGUF files on CPUs, and hence dramatically reducing the hardware requirements and expenses for fine-tuning LLMs.

Check out and download the llama.cpp source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

Build the llama.cpp binary.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

If you have NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit installed, you should build llama.cpp with CUDA support.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Get the base model

We are going to use Meta's Llama2 chat 13B model as the base model. Note that we are using a Q5 quantized GGUF model file directly to save computing resources. You can use any of the Llama2 compatible GGUF models on Hugging Face.

```
cd .. # change to the llama.cpp directory
cd models/
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-2-13B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf
```

## Create a question and answer set for fine-tuning

Next we came up with 1700+ pairs of QAs for the chemistry subject. It is like the following in a [CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.csv).

Question | Answer
----- | -------
What is unique about hydrogen? | It's the most abundant element in the universe, making up over 75% of all matter.
What is the main component of Jupiter? | Hydrogen is the main component of Jupiter and the other gas giant planets.
Can hydrogen be used as fuel? | Yes, hydrogen is used as rocket fuel. It can also power fuel cells to generate electricity.
What is mercury's atomic number? | The atomic number of mercury is 80
What is Mercury? | Mercury is a silver colored metal that is liquid at room temperature. It has an atomic number of 80 on the periodic table. It is toxic to humans.

> We used GPT-4 to help me come up many of these QAs.

Then, we wrote a [Python script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/convert.py) to convert each row in the CSV file into a sample QA in the Llama2 chat template format. Notice that each QA pair starts with `<SFT>` as an indicator for the fine-tune program to start a sample. The result [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file can now be used in fine-tuning.

Put the [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file in the `llama.cpp/models` directory with the GGUF base model.

## Finetune!

Use the following command to start the fine-tuning process on your CPUs. I am putting it in the background so that it can run continuously now.
It could take several days or even a couple of weeks depending on how many CPUs you have.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

You can check the process every few hours in the `nohup.out` file. It will report the `loss` for each iteration. You can stop the process when the `loss` goes consistently under `0.1`.

**Note 1** If you have multiple CPUs (or CPU cores), you can speed up the fine-tuning process by adding a `-t` parameter to the above command to use more threads. For example, if you have 60 CPU cores, you could do `-t 60` to use all of them.

**Note 2** If your fine-tuning process is interrupted, you can restart it from `checkpoint-250.gguf`. The next file it outputs is `checkpoint-260.gguf`.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

## Merge

The fine-tuning process updates several layers of the LLM's neural network. Those updated layers are saved in a file called `lora.bin` and you can now merge them back to the base LLM to create the new fine-tuned LLM.

```
../build/bin/export-lora --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora lora.bin --model-out chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

The result is this file.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/juntaoyuan/chemistry-assistant-13b/resolve/main/chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

**Note 3** If you want to use a checkpoint to generate a `lora.bin` file, use the following command. This is needed when you believe the final `lora.bin` is an overfit.

```
../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --only-write-lora --lora-out lora.bin
```

","Summary:
This is a comprehensive guide on how to fine-tune the Llama2 chat 13B model using the llama.cpp tool. Here's a step-by-step summary:

**Pre-requisites:**

* Install git and cmake
* Download the llama.cpp source code from GitHub
* Build the llama.cpp binary with CUDA support (if available)

**Step 1: Get the base model**

* Download the Llama2 chat 13B Q5 quantized GGUF model file from Hugging Face

**Step 2: Create a question and answer set for fine-tuning**

* Use a CSV file containing pairs of questions and answers
* Convert each row in the CSV file into a sample QA in the Llama2 chat template format using a Python script (convert.py)
* The resulting file is called `train.txt`

**Step 3: Finetune!**

* Put the `train.txt` file in the llama.cpp/models directory with the GGUF base model
* Use the following command to start the fine-tuning process on CPUs:
```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```
* The fine-tuning process may take several days or weeks depending on the number of CPUs available

**Step 4: Merge**

* Once the fine-tuning process is complete, update several layers of the LLM's neural network
* Save the updated layers in a file called `lora.bin`
* Use the following command to merge the updated layers back into the base LLM:
```
../build/bin/export-lora --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora lora.bin --model-out chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```
* The result is a new fine-tuned LLM model file

**Note 1:** If the fine-tuning process is interrupted, you can restart it from `checkpoint-250.gguf`

**Note 2:** You can speed up the fine-tuning process by using more threads (e.g., -t 60 to use all CPU cores)

**Note 3:** If you want to generate a `lora.bin` file using a checkpoint, use the following command: `../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --only-write-lora --lora-out lora.bin`"

The result [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file can now be used in fine-tuning.

Put the [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file in the `llama.cpp/models` directory with the GGUF base model.

## Finetune!

Use the following command to start the fine-tuning process on your CPUs. I am putting it in the background so that it can run continuously now.
It could take several days or even a couple of weeks depending on how many CPUs you have.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

You can check the process every few hours in the `nohup.out` file. It will report the `loss` for each iteration. You can stop the process when the `loss` goes consistently under `0.1`.

**Note 1** If you have multiple CPUs (or CPU cores), you can speed up the fine-tuning process by adding a `-t` parameter to the above command to use more threads. For example, if you have 60 CPU cores, you could do `-t 60` to use all of them.

**Note 2** If your fine-tuning process is interrupted, you can restart it from `checkpoint-250.gguf`. The next file it outputs is `checkpoint-260.gguf`.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

## Merge

The fine-tuning process updates several layers of the LLM's neural network. Those updated layers are saved in a file called `lora.bin` and you can now merge them back to the base LLM to create the new fine-tuned LLM.

```
../build/bin/export-lora --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora lora.bin --model-out chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

The result is this file.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/juntaoyuan/chemistry-assistant-13b/resolve/main/chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

**Note 3** If you want to use a checkpoint to generate a `lora.bin` file, use the following command. This is needed when you believe the final `lora.bin` is an overfit.

```
../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --only-write-lora --lora-out lora.bin
```

","Q: 1. How many CPUs are required to fine-tune LLMs with the quantized GGUF files using the `finetune` utility in llama.cpp?
A: To fine-tune LLMs with the quantized GGUF files using the `finetune` utility in llama.cpp, you do not necessarily require a lot of CPUs.

The `finetune` utility can work well on just one CPU. The actual number of CPUs required depends on several factors like:

*   The size of your training data.
*   The number of samples in each iteration.
*   The speed of your machine's CPU.
*   And possibly other factors.

However, if you have multiple CPUs available and want to fine-tune LLLs faster, you can specify the `-t` parameter with `finetune`. For instance:

```
../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 -t 60
```

This will use all available CPU cores (in this case, 60). You can adjust the number of CPUs to the value that is right for you.

**Bonus Tip**: If you are using multiple GPUs on your machine and have them properly installed, you might want to build `llama.cpp` with CUDA support. This may further speed up fine-tuning.

Here's an example of how to do this:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
cmake --build . --config Release

```

","Q: 2. What is the purpose of using Meta's Llama2 chat 13B model as the base model for fine-tuning?
A: The purpose of using Meta's Llama2 chat 13B model as the base model for fine-tuning is to leverage its pre-existing knowledge and capabilities in a general conversation setting. This large language model has been trained on a vast amount of text data, enabling it to understand natural language, generate human-like responses, and possess a broad range of knowledge.

By using Llama2 chat 13B as the base model, fine-tuning can focus on adapting this existing foundation to a specific domain or task (in this case, chemistry), rather than starting from scratch. This approach allows for several benefits:

1.  **Knowledge Transfer**: The pre-trained language model has already learned a significant amount of knowledge and relationships between concepts. Fine-tuning builds upon this foundation, allowing the model to more efficiently learn about the chemistry domain.
2.  **Reduced Training Time and Computational Resources**: Starting with a pre-trained base model significantly reduces the time and computational resources required for fine-tuning, as the model has already learned many general patterns and relationships in language.
3.  **Improved Performance**: The combination of the pre-trained language understanding capabilities and domain-specific knowledge enables the fine-tuned model to achieve better performance on chemistry-related tasks.

Fine-tuning Meta's Llama2 chat 13B model allows for a targeted adaptation to the chemistry domain, which is essential for achieving high accuracy in specific tasks like question answering, generating chemistry explanations, or predicting properties."

```

","Q: 5. How long does it take to run the fine-tuning process, depending on how many CPUs you have?
A: The fine-tuning process can take anywhere from several hours to several weeks, depending on the number of CPUs you have and the complexity of the model.

Here are some rough estimates:

* With 1 CPU (single core): 2-4 weeks
* With 4 CPUs (quad-core): 1-3 days
* With 8 CPUs (octa-core): 6-24 hours
* With 16 CPUs (hexadeca-core): 3-12 hours

Keep in mind that these estimates assume a moderate-sized model and dataset. The actual time may vary depending on the specifics of your fine-tuning setup.

**Bonus Tip**: You can speed up the process by using multiple threads (-t parameter) or by taking advantage of distributed computing (e.g., with SLURM or PBS)."

# llama.cpp

The popular llama.cpp tool comes with a `finetune` utility. It works well on CPUs! This fine-tune guide is reproduced with 
permission from Tony Yuan's [Finetune an open-source LLM for the chemistry subject](https://github.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/tree/main/fine-tune-model) project.

## Build the fine-tune utility from llama.cpp

The `finetune` utility in llama.cpp can work with quantized GGUF files on CPUs, and hence dramatically reducing the hardware requirements and expenses for fine-tuning LLMs.

Check out and download the llama.cpp source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

Build the llama.cpp binary.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

If you have NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit installed, you should build llama.cpp with CUDA support.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Get the base model

We are going to use Meta's Llama2 chat 13B model as the base model. Note that we are using a Q5 quantized GGUF model file directly to save computing resources. You can use any of the Llama2 compatible GGUF models on Hugging Face.

```
cd .. # change to the llama.cpp directory
cd models/
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-2-13B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf
```

## Create a question and answer set for fine-tuning

Next we came up with 1700+ pairs of QAs for the chemistry subject. It is like the following in a [CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.csv).

Question | Answer
----- | -------
What is unique about hydrogen? | It's the most abundant element in the universe, making up over 75% of all matter.
What is the main component of Jupiter? | Hydrogen is the main component of Jupiter and the other gas giant planets.
Can hydrogen be used as fuel? | Yes, hydrogen is used as rocket fuel. It can also power fuel cells to generate electricity.
What is mercury's atomic number? | The atomic number of mercury is 80
What is Mercury? | Mercury is a silver colored metal that is liquid at room temperature. It has an atomic number of 80 on the periodic table. It is toxic to humans.

> We used GPT-4 to help me come up many of these QAs.

Then, we wrote a [Python script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/convert.py) to convert each row in the CSV file into a sample QA in the Llama2 chat template format. Notice that each QA pair starts with `<SFT>` as an indicator for the fine-tune program to start a sample. The result [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file can now be used in fine-tuning.

Put the [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file in the `llama.cpp/models` directory with the GGUF base model.

## Finetune!

Use the following command to start the fine-tuning process on your CPUs. I am putting it in the background so that it can run continuously now.
It could take several days or even a couple of weeks depending on how many CPUs you have.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

You can check the process every few hours in the `nohup.out` file. It will report the `loss` for each iteration. You can stop the process when the `loss` goes consistently under `0.1`.

**Note 1** If you have multiple CPUs (or CPU cores), you can speed up the fine-tuning process by adding a `-t` parameter to the above command to use more threads. For example, if you have 60 CPU cores, you could do `-t 60` to use all of them.

**Note 2** If your fine-tuning process is interrupted, you can restart it from `checkpoint-250.gguf`. The next file it outputs is `checkpoint-260.gguf`.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

## Merge

The fine-tuning process updates several layers of the LLM's neural network. Those updated layers are saved in a file called `lora.bin` and you can now merge them back to the base LLM to create the new fine-tuned LLM.

```
../build/bin/export-lora --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora lora.bin --model-out chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

The result is this file.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/juntaoyuan/chemistry-assistant-13b/resolve/main/chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

**Note 3** If you want to use a checkpoint to generate a `lora.bin` file, use the following command. This is needed when you believe the final `lora.bin` is an overfit.

```
../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --only-write-lora --lora-out lora.bin
```

","Q: 6. What is the name of the result file that can now be used in fine-tuning after running the Python script to convert each row in the CSV file?
A: The result file that can now be used in fine-tuning after running the Python script to convert each row in the CSV file is called `train.txt`.

**Bonus Tip:** The Python script was written to convert each row in the CSV file into a sample QA in the Llama2 chat template format, and it's essential to ensure that each QA pair starts with `<SFT>` as an indicator for the fine-tune program to start a sample.

Here is an example of what the `train.txt` file might look like after conversion:
```
<SFT>
What is unique about hydrogen?
It's the most abundant element in the universe, making up over 75% of all matter.
<SFT>
What is the main component of Jupiter?
Hydrogen is the main component of Jupiter and the other gas giant planets.
<SFT>
Can hydrogen be used as fuel?
Yes, hydrogen is used as rocket fuel. It can also power fuel cells to generate electricity.
...
```
This `train.txt` file is then used in fine-tuning by specifying it as the `--train-data` argument in the finetune command."

","Q: 8. What parameter needs to be added to the command to use multiple threads (or CPU cores) to speed up the fine-tuning process?
A: To use multiple threads (or CPU cores) to speed up the fine-tuning process, you need to add the `-t` parameter to the command. The number of threads should be specified after the `-t` parameter.

Here is an example:

```bash
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 -t 60 &
```

In this example, the `-t 60` parameter will use all 60 CPU cores to speed up the fine-tuning process.

**Note**: The number of threads should not exceed the total number of available CPU cores. Using more threads than available CPU cores may actually slow down the fine-tuning process due to thread scheduling overhead."

../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --only-write-lora --lora-out lora.bin
```

","Q: 9. How can you restart a fine-tuning process if it is interrupted, and what file should be used as the starting point?
A: To restart a fine-tuning process that is interrupted, you can use the `--checkpoint-in` parameter to specify the checkpoint file as the starting point. The next file it outputs will be the updated checkpoint.

In this case, you should use `checkpoint-250.gguf` as the input checkpoint file. This means your command would look like this:

```bash
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

By using `--checkpoint-in` with the correct file name, you are telling the program to resume training from where it left off in that file.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're unsure which checkpoint file is the latest or most suitable for restarting from, make sure to check the contents of the output files (e.g., `nohup.out`) and use the one with the highest iteration number."

Next we came up with 1700+ pairs of QAs for the chemistry subject. It is like the following in a [CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.csv).

Question | Answer
----- | -------
What is unique about hydrogen? | It's the most abundant element in the universe, making up over 75% of all matter.
What is the main component of Jupiter? | Hydrogen is the main component of Jupiter and the other gas giant planets.
Can hydrogen be used as fuel? | Yes, hydrogen is used as rocket fuel. It can also power fuel cells to generate electricity.
What is mercury's atomic number? | The atomic number of mercury is 80
What is Mercury? | Mercury is a silver colored metal that is liquid at room temperature. It has an atomic number of 80 on the periodic table. It is toxic to humans.

> We used GPT-4 to help me come up many of these QAs.

Then, we wrote a [Python script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/convert.py) to convert each row in the CSV file into a sample QA in the Llama2 chat template format. Notice that each QA pair starts with `<SFT>` as an indicator for the fine-tune program to start a sample. The result [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file can now be used in fine-tuning.

Put the [train.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanTony/chemistry-assistant/main/fine-tune-model/train.txt) file in the `llama.cpp/models` directory with the GGUF base model.

## Finetune!

Use the following command to start the fine-tuning process on your CPUs. I am putting it in the background so that it can run continuously now.
It could take several days or even a couple of weeks depending on how many CPUs you have.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

You can check the process every few hours in the `nohup.out` file. It will report the `loss` for each iteration. You can stop the process when the `loss` goes consistently under `0.1`.

**Note 1** If you have multiple CPUs (or CPU cores), you can speed up the fine-tuning process by adding a `-t` parameter to the above command to use more threads. For example, if you have 60 CPU cores, you could do `-t 60` to use all of them.

**Note 2** If your fine-tuning process is interrupted, you can restart it from `checkpoint-250.gguf`. The next file it outputs is `checkpoint-260.gguf`.

```
nohup ../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --lora-out lora.bin --train-data train.txt --sample-start '<SFT>' --adam-iter 1024 &
```

## Merge

The fine-tuning process updates several layers of the LLM's neural network. Those updated layers are saved in a file called `lora.bin` and you can now merge them back to the base LLM to create the new fine-tuned LLM.

```
../build/bin/export-lora --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora lora.bin --model-out chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

The result is this file.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/juntaoyuan/chemistry-assistant-13b/resolve/main/chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

**Note 3** If you want to use a checkpoint to generate a `lora.bin` file, use the following command. This is needed when you believe the final `lora.bin` is an overfit.

```
../build/bin/finetune --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --checkpoint-in checkpoint-250.gguf --only-write-lora --lora-out lora.bin
```

","Q: 10. What is the output of the `export-lora` command that merges the updated layers back into the base LLM?
A: The output of the `export-lora` command that merges the updated layers back into the base LLM is a new file called `chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf`. This file is the fine-tuned LLM model.

To be more specific, the output will have the same format as the original GGUF file (e.g. `llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf`), but with the weights of the updated layers replaced by the weights from the fine-tuning process.

Here is an example of how it might look:

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/juntaoyuan/chemistry-assistant-13b/resolve/main/chemistry-assistant-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```

This file can then be used in place of the original base LLM model for downstream tasks.

**Bonus Tip**: The `export-lora` command also takes an optional `--model-out` parameter, which allows you to specify a custom name for the output file. For example: `../build/bin/export-lora --model-base llama-2-13b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf --lora lora.bin --model-out my_fine_tuned_model.gguf`. This can be useful if you want to keep the original base LLM model and use a different name for your fine-tuned model."

# Gaia nodes with long-term knowledge

The LLM app requires both long-term and short-term memories. Long-term memory includes factual knowledge, historical facts, background stories etc. They are best added to the context as complete chapters instead of small chunks of text to maintain the internal consistency of the knowledge.  

[RAG](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/) 
is an important technique to inject contextual knowledge into an LLM application. It improves accuracy and reduces the hallucination of LLMs.
An effective RAG application combines real-time and user-specific short-term memory (chunks) with stable long-term memory (chapters) in the prompt context. 

Since the application's long-term memory is stable (even immutable), we package it in a vector database tightly coupled with the LLM. The client app assembles the short-term memory in the prompt and is supplemented with the long-term memory on the LLM server. We call the approach ""server-side RAG"".

> The long context length supported by modern LLMs are especially well-suited for long-term knowledge that are best represented by chapters of text.

A Gaia node is an OpenAI
compatible LLM service that is grounded by long-term knowledge on the server side. The client application
can simply chat with it or provide realtime / short-term memory since the LLM is already aware of the 
domain or background.

> For example, if you ask ChatGPT the question What is Layer 2, the answer is that Layer 2 is a concept from the computer network. However, if you ask a blockchain person, they answer that Layer 2 is a way to scale the original Ethereum network. That's the difference between a generic LLM and knowledge-supplemented LLMs.

We will cover the external knowledge preparation and how a knowledge-supplemented LLM completes a conversation. If you have learned how a RAG application works, go to [Build a RAG application with Gaia](web-tool) to start building one.

1. Create embeddings for your own knowledge as the long-term memory.
2. Lifecycle of a user query on a knowledge-supplemented LLM.

For this solution, we will use

* a chat model like Llama-3-8B for generating responses to the user.
* a text embedding model like [nomic-embed-text](https://huggingface.co/second-state/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF) for creating and retrieving embeddings.
* a Vector DB like Qdrant for storing embeddings.

## Workflow for creating knowledge embeddings 

The first step is to create embeddings for our knowledge base and store the embeddings in a vector DB. 

![create-embedding](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs/assets/45785633/2ff40178-64f4-4e2e-bbd9-f12ce35186b7)

First of all, we split the long text into sections (i.e, chunks). All LLMs have a maximum context length. The model can't read the context if the text is too long.
The most used rule for a Gaia node is to put the content in one chapter together. Remember, insert a blank line between two chunks. You can also use other algorithms to chunk your text.

After chunking the document, we can convert these chunks into embeddings leveraging the embedding model. The embedding model is trained to create embeddings based on text and search for similar embeddings. We will use the latter function in the process of user query.

Additionally, we will need a vector DB to store the embeddings so that we can retrieve these embeddings quickly at any time. 

On a Gaia node, we will get a database snapshot with the embeddings to use at last. Check out how to create your embeddings using [Gaia web tool](web-tool.md), [from a plain text file](text.md), and [from a markdown file](markdown.md).

##  Lifecycle of a user query on a knowledge-supplemented LLM

Next, let's learn the lifecycle of a user query on a knowledge-supplemented LLM. We will take [a Gaia Node with Gaia knowledge](https://knowledge.gaianet.network/chatbot-ui/index.html) as an example.

![user-query-rag](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs/assets/45785633/c64b85ea-65f0-43d2-8ab3-78889d21c248)

### Ask a question

when you send a question in human language to the node, the embedding model will first convert your question to embedding.

### Retrieve similar embeddings

Then, the embedding model will search all the embeddings stored in the Qdrant vector DB and retrieve the embeddings that are similar to the question embeddings.

### Response to the user query

The embedding node will return the retrieved embeddings to the chat model. The chat model will use the retrieved embeddings plus your input questions as context to answer your queries finally.

","Summary:
**Gaia Nodes with Long-term Knowledge**

A Gaia node is an OpenAI-compatible LLM service that incorporates long-term knowledge on the server side. This approach, called ""server-side RAG"" (Retrieval Augmented Generation), improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations in LLMs.

**Key Components**

1. **Long-term Memory**: Stable and immutable knowledge base stored in a vector database tightly coupled with the LLM.
2. **Short-term Memory**: User-specific short-term memory assembled by the client application and supplemented with long-term memory on the LLM server.
3. **Embedding Model**: Trained to create embeddings based on text, used for search and retrieval of similar embeddings.

**Workflow**

1. **Create Embeddings**: Split long text into sections (chunks), convert chunks into embeddings using an embedding model, and store them in a vector database (e.g., Qdrant).
2. **Lifecycle of User Query**:
	* **Ask Question**: Client application sends human language question to the node.
	* **Retrieve Similar Embeddings**: Embedding model searches for similar embeddings in the vector database.
	* **Response**: Chat model uses retrieved embeddings and input questions as context to answer user queries.

**Tools and Models**

1. **Llama-3-8B**: Chat model used for generating responses to user queries.
2. **Nomic-embed-text**: Text embedding model for creating and retrieving embeddings.
3. **Qdrant**: Vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.

This comprehensive guide covers the external knowledge preparation, Gaia nodes with long-term knowledge, and the lifecycle of a user query on a knowledge-supplemented LLM. It also highlights the necessary tools and models used in this solution."

![user-query-rag](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs/assets/45785633/c64b85ea-65f0-43d2-8ab3-78889d21c248)

","Q: What is RAG?
A: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to improve the performance and accuracy of large language models (LLMs). RAG involves combining the strengths of two different types of models:

1.  **Retrieval model**: This model is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a large database or knowledge base. It uses embeddings ( numerical representations ) to match the input query with the most similar information in the database.
2.  **Generation model**: This model generates text based on the input query and the retrieved information. It uses the context and knowledge gathered from the retrieval model to produce a coherent and accurate response.

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation process typically involves the following steps:

*   The user provides an input query or question.
*   The retrieval model searches the database for relevant information related to the input query.
*   The retrieved information is used as context by the generation model to generate a response.
*   The generated response is refined and updated based on the input query.

RAG has several benefits, including:

1.  **Improved accuracy**: By using a retrieval model to gather relevant information, RAG can improve the accuracy of the generated responses.
2.  **Reduced hallucination**: RAG can reduce the occurrence of ""hallucinations,"" where the LLM generates information that is not present in the input or training data.
3.  **Enhanced context understanding**: The retrieval model helps the generation model to better understand the context and nuances of the input query.

RAG is particularly useful for applications that require high-accuracy and informative responses, such as:

1.  **Question answering systems**
2.  **Chatbots**
3.  **Language translation**
4.  **Text summarization**

Some popular RAG-based models include:

1.  **T5** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
2.  **BART** (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)
3.  **Pegasus** (Pre-trained Encoder with Generative Summarizer)

These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and machine translation.

By combining the strengths of retrieval and generation models, RAG has revolutionized the field of natural language processing and enabled the development of more accurate, informative, and engaging AI systems."

","Q: What does LLM stand for?
A: LLM stands for Large Language Model. 

A Large Language Model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that is designed to process and generate human-like language. These models are typically trained on massive datasets of text from the internet, books, articles, and other sources, which allows them to learn patterns and structures of language.

The goal of an LLM is to be able to understand the meaning of a piece of text, predict what comes next in a sentence or paragraph, and even generate new text that sounds like it was written by a human. 

LLMs have many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, language translation tools, text summarization systems, and more.

In the context of this solution, we use an LLM model called ""Llama-3-8B"" as our chat model for generating responses to user queries.

> A bonus tip: The term ""LLM"" is often used interchangeably with other terms like NLP (Natural Language Processing) models or language generation models. However, it's worth noting that LLM typically refers specifically to a type of AI model that is trained on large amounts of text data and designed for natural language understanding and generation tasks."

The first step is to create embeddings for our knowledge base and store the embeddings in a vector DB. 

![create-embedding](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs/assets/45785633/2ff40178-64f4-4e2e-bbd9-f12ce35186b7)

First of all, we split the long text into sections (i.e, chunks). All LLMs have a maximum context length. The model can't read the context if the text is too long.
The most used rule for a Gaia node is to put the content in one chapter together. Remember, insert a blank line between two chunks. You can also use other algorithms to chunk your text.

After chunking the document, we can convert these chunks into embeddings leveraging the embedding model. The embedding model is trained to create embeddings based on text and search for similar embeddings. We will use the latter function in the process of user query.

Additionally, we will need a vector DB to store the embeddings so that we can retrieve these embeddings quickly at any time. 

On a Gaia node, we will get a database snapshot with the embeddings to use at last. Check out how to create your embeddings using [Gaia web tool](web-tool.md), [from a plain text file](text.md), and [from a markdown file](markdown.md).

##  Lifecycle of a user query on a knowledge-supplemented LLM

Next, let's learn the lifecycle of a user query on a knowledge-supplemented LLM. We will take [a Gaia Node with Gaia knowledge](https://knowledge.gaianet.network/chatbot-ui/index.html) as an example.

![user-query-rag](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs/assets/45785633/c64b85ea-65f0-43d2-8ab3-78889d21c248)

### Ask a question

when you send a question in human language to the node, the embedding model will first convert your question to embedding.

### Retrieve similar embeddings

Then, the embedding model will search all the embeddings stored in the Qdrant vector DB and retrieve the embeddings that are similar to the question embeddings.

### Response to the user query

The embedding node will return the retrieved embeddings to the chat model. The chat model will use the retrieved embeddings plus your input questions as context to answer your queries finally.

","Q: What is the purpose of storing long-term memory in a vector database tightly coupled with the LLM?
A: The purpose of storing long-term memory in a vector database tightly coupled with the LLM is to enable efficient and scalable retrieval of contextual knowledge for generating accurate and consistent responses.

Here are some key benefits of this approach:

1.  **Efficient Retrieval**: By storing embeddings in a vector database like Qdrant, we can quickly retrieve similar embeddings based on user queries, reducing the time it takes to retrieve relevant information from large knowledge bases.
2.  **Scalability**: This architecture allows for easy scalability as the size of the knowledge base increases. We can simply add more data points to the vector database without affecting the performance of the LLM.
3.  **Improved Accuracy**: By providing contextually relevant information, the LLM can generate more accurate and informative responses that are tailored to specific conversations or topics.
4.  **Reduced Hallucination**: The use of embeddings helps reduce the likelihood of the LLM generating ""hallucinated"" information, which occurs when the model generates text based on its understanding of language rather than actual knowledge.

By tightly coupling the vector database with the LLM, we create a robust and efficient knowledge retrieval system that supports the generation of high-quality responses. This is especially important for applications like Gaia nodes where long-term memory plays a crucial role in providing accurate and informative answers to user queries.

**Bonus Tip:** Consider using dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA or t-SNE, to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings before storing them in the vector database. This can help improve query efficiency and reduce storage requirements without sacrificing too much accuracy."

# Gaia nodes with long-term knowledge

The LLM app requires both long-term and short-term memories. Long-term memory includes factual knowledge, historical facts, background stories etc. They are best added to the context as complete chapters instead of small chunks of text to maintain the internal consistency of the knowledge.  

[RAG](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/) 
is an important technique to inject contextual knowledge into an LLM application. It improves accuracy and reduces the hallucination of LLMs.
An effective RAG application combines real-time and user-specific short-term memory (chunks) with stable long-term memory (chapters) in the prompt context. 

Since the application's long-term memory is stable (even immutable), we package it in a vector database tightly coupled with the LLM. The client app assembles the short-term memory in the prompt and is supplemented with the long-term memory on the LLM server. We call the approach ""server-side RAG"".

> The long context length supported by modern LLMs are especially well-suited for long-term knowledge that are best represented by chapters of text.

A Gaia node is an OpenAI
compatible LLM service that is grounded by long-term knowledge on the server side. The client application
can simply chat with it or provide realtime / short-term memory since the LLM is already aware of the 
domain or background.

> For example, if you ask ChatGPT the question What is Layer 2, the answer is that Layer 2 is a concept from the computer network. However, if you ask a blockchain person, they answer that Layer 2 is a way to scale the original Ethereum network. That's the difference between a generic LLM and knowledge-supplemented LLMs.

We will cover the external knowledge preparation and how a knowledge-supplemented LLM completes a conversation. If you have learned how a RAG application works, go to [Build a RAG application with Gaia](web-tool) to start building one.

### Response to the user query

The embedding node will return the retrieved embeddings to the chat model. The chat model will use the retrieved embeddings plus your input questions as context to answer your queries finally.

","Q: How is short-term memory assembled by the client app? 
A: According to the provided context, short-term memory is assembled by the client app as follows:

When a user sends a query to the Gaia node, the client app will assemble the short-term memory in the prompt. This involves converting the user's input (i.e., their question) into an embedding using the embedding model.

The client app will then send this embedded query to the Gaia node along with any additional context or information that is relevant to the conversation.

The Gaia node, which has access to both the long-term memory stored in the vector DB and the short-term memory assembled by the client app, can then use this combined context to generate a response to the user's question.

In essence, the client app plays a crucial role in collecting and preparing the short-term memory for the Gaia node, which uses this information in conjunction with its long-term knowledge base to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries.

**Bonus Tip**: The way the client app assembles short-term memory can significantly impact the quality of the response generated by the Gaia node. Therefore, it's essential to design an efficient and effective process for assembling short-term memory that takes into account the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the Gaia node.

**Example**: Suppose you're building a chatbot that helps users troubleshoot technical issues with their smartphones. The client app might assemble short-term memory by collecting information about the user's device, such as its model number, operating system version, and any error messages they've encountered. This information would be embedded using the embedding model and sent to the Gaia node along with the user's question, allowing the chatbot to provide more accurate and relevant responses based on the combined context."

For example, if you ask a Gaia Node what Layer 2 is, the answer would be context-dependent: a computer network concept or a way to scale the Ethereum network, depending on who you are asking (a generic LLM or a blockchain person). This shows the difference between a generic LLM and knowledge-supplemented LLMs.

**Bonus Tip:** To implement a Gaia Node with server-side RAG, you'll need to create embeddings for your own knowledge as long-term memory, store them in a vector DB like Qdrant, and use an embedding model like Nomic-embed-text to convert text into embeddings.

A: To maintain the internal consistency of knowledge, Gaia nodes can store text in chunks instead of as small text chunks. Here are some examples of what can be stored as chunks:

2.  **Technical guides**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up software, hardware, or networks.
3.  **Case studies**: In-depth analysis of real-world scenarios or business cases to demonstrate concepts.
4.  **Biographies**: Detailed life stories of influential individuals, including their achievements and challenges.
5.  **Historical events**: Comprehensive accounts of significant historical events, including causes, effects, and key players.
6.  **Theoretical frameworks**: Elaborate explanations of abstract theories like psychology, sociology, or philosophy.
7.  **Policy documents**: Detailed reports on government policies, laws, or regulations.
8.  **Industry standards**: Official guidelines for industries like medicine, finance, or aviation.

These types of content can be stored as chunks to ensure that the knowledge is presented in a coherent and structured manner, making it easier for users to understand and reference.

**Bonus Tip:** When storing content as chunks, consider using markdown formatting to make it easy to read and format. Additionally, use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up large blocks of text and improve readability."

","Q:  What is used to represent similar embeddings?
A: In the context of embedding-based knowledge representation and retrieval, similarity between embeddings is typically measured using a distance metric or a scoring function that captures the semantic relationship between two vectors.

Common techniques used to represent similar embeddings include:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a high-dimensional space. Vectors with a small angle (i.e., close to orthogonal) are considered similar.
2. **Euclidean Distance**: Calculates the straight-line distance between two points in n-dimensional space. This metric is sensitive to scaling and rotation, making it less suitable for high-dimensional spaces.
3. **Minkowski Distance** (e.g., L1, L2): Generalizes the Euclidean distance by using a power parameter p to control the weight of each dimension. For example, Minkowski distance with p = 2 is equivalent to the Euclidean distance.
4. **Manhattan Distance** (L1 distance): Measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements in two vectors.

However, when dealing with high-dimensional embeddings, these distance metrics may not always capture semantic relationships accurately.

To address this challenge, researchers have developed more sophisticated techniques:

1. **Hadamard Product**: Computes an element-wise product of two vectors, resulting in a vector that represents the similarity between the original vectors.
2. **Dot-Product**: Computes the sum of products of corresponding elements in two vectors, providing an indication of similarity or correlation.

In the context of Gaia nodes with long-term knowledge, these techniques are used to compute similarities between embeddings and retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.

**Bonus Tip:**

When selecting a distance metric for similarity computation, consider the following factors:

* **Interpretability**: Choose a metric that provides an intuitive understanding of the relationship between vectors.
* **Robustness**: Select a metric that is resistant to noise or outliers in the data.
* **Computational efficiency**: Opt for metrics with efficient algorithms for computing similarities."

# Knowledge base from source / summary pairs

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot for optimal retrieval of 
long-form text documents. The approach is to create two columns of text in a CSV file.

* The first column is the long-form source text from the knowledge document, such as a book chapter or a markdown section.
* The long-form source text is difficult to search. The second column is a ""search-friendly"" summary of the source text. It could contain a list of questions that can be answered by the first column source text.

We will create a vector snapshot where each vector is computed from the summary text (second column), but the 
retrieved source text for that vector is from the first column.
The snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

> We have a simple Python script to build properly formatted CSV files from a set of articles or chapters. [See how it works](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/csv_embed#create-a-csv-file).

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base.

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to create embeddings from the CSV file.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/csv_embed/csv_embed.wasm
```

You can check out the [Rust source code](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/csv_embed) here and modify it if you need to use a different CSV layout.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the CSV document. 
The `--ctx_size` option matches the embedding model's context window size, which in this case is 8192 tokens allowing it to process long sections of text. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from `paris.csv` and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.csv

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.csv --ctx_size 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.
* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.csv -c 8192 -l 1 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

# Knowledge base from source / summary pairs

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot for optimal retrieval of 
long-form text documents. The approach is to create two columns of text in a CSV file.

* The first column is the long-form source text from the knowledge document, such as a book chapter or a markdown section.
* The long-form source text is difficult to search. The second column is a ""search-friendly"" summary of the source text. It could contain a list of questions that can be answered by the first column source text.

We will create a vector snapshot where each vector is computed from the summary text (second column), but the 
retrieved source text for that vector is from the first column.
The snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

> We have a simple Python script to build properly formatted CSV files from a set of articles or chapters. [See how it works](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/csv_embed#create-a-csv-file).

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base.

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to create embeddings from the CSV file.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/csv_embed/csv_embed.wasm
```

You can check out the [Rust source code](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/csv_embed) here and modify it if you need to use a different CSV layout.

Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from `paris.csv` and saves them into the default collection.

  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.csv --ctx_size 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.
* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.

   csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.csv -c 8192 -l 1 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

","Q: What is the command to create a new collection called default?
A: The command to create a new collection called ""default"" is:

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

This command creates a new collection called ""default"" with 768 dimensions, using the Cosine distance metric, and stores the vectors on disk. 

### Bonus tip:
You can also use the following command to create a new collection without specifying the vector size. In this case, Qdrant will automatically determine the vector size based on the embeddings generated.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

However, you should be aware that using automatic vector size determination can lead to performance issues if the vector sizes are not consistent across all vectors in the collection."

","Q: Can the program be run multiple times on different documents in the same vector collection?
A: Yes, the program can be run multiple times on different documents in the same vector collection. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind.

To run the program multiple times, you need to specify a few additional options:

* `--start_vector_id`: This option specifies the starting vector ID for the new document. If this is not specified, the program will start from the end of the existing collection.
* `--append_to_existing_collection`: This option appends the new document to the existing collection instead of overwriting it.

You can use these options in combination with each other to run the program multiple times on different documents in the same vector collection.

Here is an example:

```bash
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.csv --ctx_size 8192

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.csv --ctx_size 8192 --start_vector_id 42
```

In this example, the first run will create a new vector collection with `paris.csv`. The second run will append `london.csv` to the existing collection starting from index 42.

**Bonus Tip:** To make it easier to manage multiple documents in the same vector collection, you can use a script that takes care of running the program for each document and appending them to the existing collection. This way, you can simply pass a list of files or directories to the script and it will take care of creating the vector collection.

Here is an example Python script:
```python
import os

def run_csv_embed(file_list, start_vector_id):
    wasmedge_cmd = f""wasmedge --dir .:. \
      --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
      csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 {file_list} --ctx_size 8192""
    
    if start_vector_id:
        wasmedge_cmd += f"" --start_vector_id {start_vector_id}""
    
    os.system(wasmedge_cmd)

# Example usage
files = [""paris.csv"", ""london.csv""]
start_vector_id = 42

run_csv_embed("" "".join(files), start_vector_id)
```
This script takes a list of files and an optional `start_vector_id` as input. It runs the `csv_embed.wasm` program for each file in the list, appending them to the existing vector collection if a `start_vector_id` is specified."

curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/csv_embed/csv_embed.wasm
```

You can check out the [Rust source code](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/csv_embed) here and modify it if you need to use a different CSV layout.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the CSV document. 
The `--ctx_size` option matches the embedding model's context window size, which in this case is 8192 tokens allowing it to process long sections of text. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from `paris.csv` and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.csv

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.csv --ctx_size 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.
* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.csv -c 8192 -l 1 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

Have fun!
","Q: How can you pass options to the wasm app?
A: You can pass options to the wasm app using command-line arguments. 

Here are a few examples.

* **Context size**: You can pass the context size as an option by using either `-c` or `--ctx_size`.
```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  csv_embed.wasm -c 8192
```

* **Maximum context length**: You can pass a maximum context length by using the `-l` or `--maximum_context_length` option. If the input text segment is longer than this value, it will be truncated and you will get a warning message.
```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   csv_embed.wasm -c 8192 -l 100
```

* **Start vector ID**: If you want to append the new document to a previously created collection starting from an index other than zero, you can use the `-s` or `--start_vector_id` option. For example:
```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   csv_embed.wasm -c 8192 -l 100 -s 42
```"

# Knowledge base from source / summary pairs

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot for optimal retrieval of 
long-form text documents. The approach is to create two columns of text in a CSV file.

* The first column is the long-form source text from the knowledge document, such as a book chapter or a markdown section.
* The long-form source text is difficult to search. The second column is a ""search-friendly"" summary of the source text. It could contain a list of questions that can be answered by the first column source text.

We will create a vector snapshot where each vector is computed from the summary text (second column), but the 
retrieved source text for that vector is from the first column.
The snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

> We have a simple Python script to build properly formatted CSV files from a set of articles or chapters. [See how it works](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/csv_embed#create-a-csv-file).

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base.

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to create embeddings from the CSV file.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/csv_embed/csv_embed.wasm

","Q: What is the default context size of the input for the wasm app?
A: The default context size of the input for the wasm app is 512. This can be specified by using the `-c` or `--ctx_size` option when running the program.

**Example**

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  csv_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.csv --ctx_size 8192
```

In this example, the context size is set to 8192 tokens, but it defaults to 512 if not specified.

**Bonus tip**: You can also specify the context length in the CLI argument by using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length`. This will truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length."

","Q: Where can the snapshot file be found after creating it?
A: After creating the snapshot, you can find the snapshot file in the following locations:

* In the current working directory where you ran the `wasmedge` command. The snapshot file is usually named `my.snapshot`.
* In the `qdrant_snapshots` directory if you were running a Docker container.

If you were running a Gaia node, you can also find the snapshot file in the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory.

To be sure, you can check these locations and verify that the snapshot file exists there.

### Bonus Tip

You should compress the snapshot file using tools like `tar` or `gzip` before uploading it to Huggingface. This will reduce the size of the file and make it easier to upload."

# Knowledge base from a URL

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot from a Web URL. First, we will parse the URL to a structured markdown file. Then, we will follow the steps from [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to create embedding for your URL.

## Parse the URL content to a markdown file

Firecrawl can crawl and convert any website into LLM-ready markdown or structured data. It also supports crawling a URL and all accessible subpages.

> To use Firecrawl, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) and get an API key.

First, install the dependencies. We are assuming that you already have Node.JS 20+ installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/JYC0413/firecrawl-integration.git
cd firecrawl-integration
npm install
```

Then, export the API key in the terminal.

```
export FIRECRAWL_KEY=""your_api_key_here""
```

next, we can use the following command line to run the service.

```
node crawlWebToMd.js
```

After the application is running successfully, you will see the prompt appear on the Terminal.

![](firecrawl-01.png)

You can type your URL in the terminal right now. Here we have two choices.

* Multiple pages: input your link with `/` at the end, the program will crawl and convert the page and its subpages to one single markdown file. This way will cost lots of API token usage.
* One single page:  input your link without `/` at the end. the program will crawl and convert the current page to one single markdown file.

The output markdown file will be located in this folder named `output.md`. 

## Create embeddings from the markdown files

Please follow the tutorial [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to convert your markdown file to a snapshot of embeddings that can be imported into a GaiaNet node.
","Summary:
**Knowledge Base from a URL**

This section covers the process of creating a vector collection snapshot from a Web URL. The steps involve parsing the URL to a structured markdown file using Firecrawl, and then following the same steps as in [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to create embeddings for the URL.

**Step 1: Parse the URL content to a markdown file**

Firecrawl can crawl and convert any website into LLM-ready markdown or structured data. It also supports crawling a URL and its accessible subpages. To use Firecrawl, sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) and get an API key.

**Installation and Setup**

npm install
```

Export the API key in the terminal:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_KEY=""your_api_key_here""
```

**Running the Service**

Use the following command to run the service:

```
node crawlWebToMd.js
```

After successful execution, a prompt will appear on the Terminal. Enter your URL to convert it to a markdown file.

**Two Options for Inputting URLs**

1. **Multiple pages**: Input your link with `/` at the end to crawl and convert the page and its subpages into one single markdown file (high API token usage).
2. **One single page**: Input your link without `/` at the end to crawl and convert only the current page into a markdown file.

**Output Markdown File**

The generated markdown file will be saved in the `output.md` folder.

**Step 2: Create Embeddings from the Markdown Files**

A: Yes, a specific API key is required to use Firecrawl. As stated in the text:

> To use Firecrawl, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) and get an API key.

This means that users must create an account with Firecrawl and obtain an API key in order to access and utilize the service. This is likely a requirement for security and authentication purposes, as well as to manage API token usage.

**Bonus Tip:** Be sure to keep your API key secure and do not share it with others. You can also consider using environment variables or a secrets manager to store and manage your API keys in a more secure way.

**Example Outside of the Content:** If you're planning to use Firecrawl extensively, you may want to consider setting up a separate user account for your project or service, rather than using your personal account. This can help keep your projects organized and make it easier to manage access permissions."

Please follow the tutorial [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to convert your markdown file to a snapshot of embeddings that can be imported into a GaiaNet node.
","Q: Which version of Node.JS is recommended for installation?
A: The version of Node.JS recommended for installation is 20 or later, as stated in the documentation.

Using a newer version of Node.js can provide several benefits, including:

* Better performance
* Improved security
* Support for new features and libraries
* Easier maintenance and updates

It's also worth noting that using an outdated version of Node.js can lead to issues such as compatibility problems with packages, security vulnerabilities, and difficulty in finding support.

Here are some examples of versions that are not recommended:

* Node.js 14: This is an LTS (Long-Term Support) release, but it has reached end-of-life and no longer receives updates or security patches.
* Node.js 18: While this is a newer version, it's still relatively old and may have compatibility issues with some packages.

On the other hand, using a recent version such as Node.js 20 or 22 will provide the best experience and ensure that you have access to the latest features and updates.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're new to Node.js, consider using a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) to easily install and manage packages."

node crawlWebToMd.js
```

After the application is running successfully, you will see the prompt appear on the Terminal.

![](firecrawl-01.png)

You can type your URL in the terminal right now. Here we have two choices.

* Multiple pages: input your link with `/` at the end, the program will crawl and convert the page and its subpages to one single markdown file. This way will cost lots of API token usage.
* One single page:  input your link without `/` at the end. the program will crawl and convert the current page to one single markdown file.

The output markdown file will be located in this folder named `output.md`. 

## Create embeddings from the markdown files

Please follow the tutorial [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to convert your markdown file to a snapshot of embeddings that can be imported into a GaiaNet node.
","Q: Where should the API key be exported in the terminal?
A: The API key should be exported in the terminal before running the command to crawl and convert the website. This is typically done by typing:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_KEY=""your_api_key_here""
```

After exporting the API key, you can then run the command to start the crawling process:

```bash
node crawlWebToMd.js
```

Make sure to replace `""your_api_key_here""` with your actual Firecrawl API key.

**Bonus Tip:** It's a good practice to add this line of code to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file so that the API key is automatically exported every time you start a new terminal session. This way, you won't have to remember to export it manually every time."

","Q: Does the program crawl and convert multiple pages or only one single page by default?
A: By default, the program crawls and converts only one single page. You need to specify the URL with a `/` at the end if you want it to crawl and convert multiple pages.

For example, if you enter `https://example.com` (without a trailing slash), it will only crawl and convert that single page. However, if you enter `https://example.com/` (with a trailing slash), it will crawl and convert not just the specified page but also all its subpages, resulting in a larger output markdown file.

So, to explicitly specify crawling of multiple pages, make sure to add a `/` at the end of the URL when entering it into the program."

Please follow the tutorial [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to convert your markdown file to a snapshot of embeddings that can be imported into a GaiaNet node.
","Q: What happens to the remaining API tokens if the user chooses the first option?
A: If the user chooses the first option, which is to crawl and convert multiple subpages of a website by appending a slash (/) at the end of the URL, it will consume a large number of API tokens. 

According to Firecrawl's documentation, each crawled webpage consumes one API token. However, this also depends on the complexity of the webpage (e.g., JavaScript-heavy websites may require more tokens), but for simplicity, let's assume one token per page.

Assuming you have 100 API tokens available and you crawl a website with 10 subpages using the first option, all 100 API tokens will be consumed. 

However, if you choose to crawl only the main webpage without the slash (second option) in this example, only 1-5 API tokens would be used depending on the complexity of the webpage.

After consuming the required number of tokens for crawling and converting the subpages, any remaining unused tokens will simply expire at the end of the billing cycle. They won't accumulate or roll over to the next cycle. 

**Bonus Tip:** To avoid running out of API tokens, consider using Firecrawl's tiered pricing plans, which offer more tokens for a fixed price per month. This way, you can crawl and convert as many webpages as your plan allows without worrying about exceeding token limits."

A: To crawl and convert a single page, you simply need to input your URL without the trailing `/` in the terminal. Here's an example:

```
node crawlWebToMd.js
> http://www.example.com
```

By not adding the `/`, Firecrawl will assume that you want to crawl and convert only the specified page, rather than its subpages.

## Bonus Tip

When using Firecrawl to crawl a single page, it's also important to note that the program may still make additional requests to fetch resources like images, CSS files, or JavaScript files if they are linked from the page. If you want to avoid this and only crawl the HTML content of the page, you can use the `--no-fetch` flag when running the command:

```
node crawlWebToMd.js --no-fetch http://www.example.com

# Knowledge base from a markdown file

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot from a markdown file. The
snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

The markdown file is segmented into multiple sections by headings. [See an example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.md). Each section is turned into a vector, and when
retrieved, added to the prompt context for the LLM.

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base.

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to segment the markdown document and create embeddings.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/markdown_embed/markdown_embed.wasm
```

It chunks the document based on markdown sections. You can check out the [Rust source code](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/markdown_embed) here and modify it if you need to use a different chunking strategy.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the source document. You can pass in the desired markdown heading level for chunking using the `--heading_level` option. The `--ctx_size` option matches the embedding model's context window size, which in this case is 8192 tokens allowing it to process long sections of text. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from `paris.md` and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.md

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.md --heading_level 1 --ctx_size 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.
* Using `-l` or `--heading_level` to specify the markdown heading level for each vector. This defaults to 1.
* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.md -c 8192 -l 1 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

# Knowledge base from a markdown file

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot from a markdown file. The
snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

The markdown file is segmented into multiple sections by headings. [See an example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.md). Each section is turned into a vector, and when
retrieved, added to the prompt context for the LLM.

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base.

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to segment the markdown document and create embeddings.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/markdown_embed/markdown_embed.wasm
```

It chunks the document based on markdown sections. You can check out the [Rust source code](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/markdown_embed) here and modify it if you need to use a different chunking strategy.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the source document. You can pass in the desired markdown heading level for chunking using the `--heading_level` option. The `--ctx_size` option matches the embedding model's context window size, which in this case is 8192 tokens allowing it to process long sections of text. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from `paris.md` and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.md

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.md --heading_level 1 --ctx_size 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.
* Using `-l` or `--heading_level` to specify the markdown heading level for each vector. This defaults to 1.
* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.md -c 8192 -l 1 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

","Q: How will you create a vector collection snapshot from a markdown file?
A: To create a vector collection snapshot from a markdown file, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Prerequisites

You need to install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Also, download an embedding model.

```bash
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

## Step 2: Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```bash
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

## Step 3: Delete the default collection

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

## Step 4: Create a new collection

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

## Step 5: Download a program to segment the markdown document and create embeddings

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/markdown_embed/markdown_embed.wasm
```

## Step 6: Run the wasm app

```bash
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.md --heading_level 1 --ctx_size 8192
```

## Step 7: Create a vector snapshot

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

Also, compress the snapshot file.

```bash
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Bonus tip

*   You can pass various options to the wasm app, such as specifying the context size of the input using `-c` or `--ctx_size`, specifying the markdown heading level for each vector using `-l` or `--heading_level`, truncating and warning for each text segment that goes above the maximum context length using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length`, and running this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection starting from a specific index using `-s` or `--start_vector_id`.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```bash
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.md -c 8192 -l 1 -s 42
```

By following these steps, you will have successfully created a vector collection snapshot from a markdown file and can use it for various tasks such as starting a Gaia node or customizing the node."

","Q: What does the Qdrant instance do when started by default?
A: When started by default, the Qdrant instance is configured to act as a vector database. Once it's running, you can use it to create and manage collections of vectors.

Here are some key actions that the default Qdrant instance performs:

1.  **Creating a default collection**: The default Qdrant instance automatically creates a ""default"" collection when started. This is where any subsequent vectors will be added.
2.  **Accepting vector uploads**: You can use various APIs to upload vectors into this default collection, which could be generated from text documents, embeddings, or other data sources.
3.  **Indexing and searching**: Qdrant maintains an index of all the vectors stored within its collections. When you search for similar vectors using a query (a single vector or multiple vectors), it performs efficient similarity searches across the entire database to find matching results.

When the Gaia node starts, it will use this default Qdrant instance as the knowledge base. This enables various features, such as:

*   **Embedding-based search**: The LLM can use the vectors in the default collection to perform embedding-based searches and retrieve relevant information.
*   **Contextualization**: The vectors in the default collection serve as a contextual background for the text prompts provided to the LLM.

By leveraging Qdrant's capabilities, Gaia node users gain access to powerful search and retrieval functionalities based on vector similarity, enhancing their interactions with the LLM.

**Bonus tip:** If you want to create multiple collections or customize your Qdrant instance further, you can explore the Qdrant documentation for more advanced configuration options."

# Knowledge base from a markdown file

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot from a markdown file. The
snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

The markdown file is segmented into multiple sections by headings. [See an example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.md). Each section is turned into a vector, and when
retrieved, added to the prompt context for the LLM.

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base.

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to segment the markdown document and create embeddings.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/markdown_embed/markdown_embed.wasm
```

It chunks the document based on markdown sections. You can check out the [Rust source code](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/markdown_embed) here and modify it if you need to use a different chunking strategy.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the source document. You can pass in the desired markdown heading level for chunking using the `--heading_level` option. The `--ctx_size` option matches the embedding model's context window size, which in this case is 8192 tokens allowing it to process long sections of text. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from `paris.md` and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris.md

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris.md --heading_level 1 --ctx_size 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.
* Using `-l` or `--heading_level` to specify the markdown heading level for each vector. This defaults to 1.
* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   markdown_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.md -c 8192 -l 1 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

","Q: What is the purpose of embedding model nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf in this context?
A: The embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf` is a special type of Large Language Model (LLM) that has been pre-trained to map input text into numerical vector representations, also known as embeddings.

In this specific context, the purpose of the embedding model is to convert sentences or sections of text from a markdown document into 768-dimensional vector representations. These vectors can then be stored in a vector database like Qdrant and used for various tasks such as:

1. **Vector similarity search**: The vectors can be searched for similarities with other vectors in the database, allowing for efficient retrieval of relevant information.
2. **Knowledge graph construction**: The vectors can be used to construct knowledge graphs, where each node represents a concept or entity and is connected to other nodes based on their vector similarity.

The embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf` is specifically designed for this task and has been trained on a large corpus of text data to learn the relationships between words and concepts. By using this model, the vectors generated from the markdown document will be semantically meaningful and can be used to capture the underlying structure of the knowledge domain.

The `f16.gguf` suffix in the model name suggests that it is a 16-bit floating-point (f16) version of the model, optimized for efficient computation on edge devices. This is likely intended for use cases where the vector database needs to be deployed on resource-constrained devices.

In summary, the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf` serves as a critical component in the knowledge base creation pipeline, enabling the conversion of text into numerical representations that can be stored and queried efficiently in a vector database."

","Q: What is the function of the markdown embed tool in the process of creating vector snapshots from a markdown file? 
A: The markdown embed tool is a program that segments a markdown document into multiple sections based on markdown headings. It then uses an embedding model to create vectors from each section and saves them into a Qdrant vector database.

Here's the step-by-step process of how it works:

1. **Chunking**: The markdown embed tool reads the input markdown file and identifies the different sections based on the markdown heading levels (e.g., `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc.). It then breaks down the document into individual sections, where each section corresponds to a specific heading level.
2. **Vectorization**: For each section identified in step 1, the markdown embed tool uses an embedding model to create a vector representation of that section. The embedding model takes the text in the section as input and produces a dense vector that captures the semantic meaning of that section.
3. **Vector saving**: Once the vectors are created for all sections, the markdown embed tool saves them into a Qdrant vector database.

By using this process, the markdown embed tool enables you to create a vector snapshot from a markdown file by:

* Breaking down the document into individual sections based on markdown headings
* Creating vector representations of each section using an embedding model
* Saving these vectors into a Qdrant vector database

This allows you to leverage the benefits of vectorized representation for your knowledge graph and enable efficient querying, similarity search, and other advanced analytics.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose you have a markdown file containing information about Paris, including different sections on landmarks, culture, cuisine, and history. You can use the markdown embed tool to create vectors from each section and save them into a Qdrant database. This would allow you to:

* Query the database for similar places or topics
* Perform similarity searches to find related information
* Analyze the vector representations to understand relationships between concepts

By creating a vector snapshot from your markdown file, you can unlock new insights and opportunities for knowledge discovery and exploration."

","Q: Which dimension should you use when creating a new collection called default if you are using an embedding model with output vectors of size 1280?
A: When using an embedding model with output vectors of size 1280, you should create a new collection called default and specify the dimension as 1280 when creating it. This ensures that the vector database is configured to store vectors of the correct size.

Here's an example:

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 1280,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Using the correct dimension is crucial to ensure that the vector database stores and retrieves vectors correctly, which is essential for efficient knowledge retrieval and search."

## Tools to convert a PDF file to a markdown file

### Tool #1: LlamaParse

LlamaParse is a tool to parse files for optimal RAG. You will need a LlamaCloud key from https://cloud.llamaindex.ai.

First, install the dependencies. we are assuming that you already have Node.JS 20+ installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/alabulei1/llamaparse-integration.git
cd llamaparse-integration
npm install llamaindex
npm install dotenv
```

Then, edit the `.env` file to set up the PDF file path and LlamaCloud Key. In this case, you don't need to care about the LLM-related settings.

After that, run the following command line to parse your pdf into a markdown file.

```
npx tsx transMd.ts
```

The output markdown file will be located in this folder named `output.md` by default. You can change the path in the `.env `file.


### Tool #2: GPTPDF

GPTPDF is an open-source tool using GPT-4o to parse PDF into markdown. You will need an OpenAI key here.

First, install the gptpdf software.

```
pip install gptpdf
```

Then, enter the Python environment.

```
python
```

Next, use the following command to parse your pdf.

```
from gptpdf import parse_pdf
api_key = 'Your OpenAI API Key'
content, image_paths = parse_pdf(Your_Pdf_Path, api_key=api_key)
print(content)
```

The output markdown files called `output.md` will be located in your root directory.

## Create embeddings from the markdown files

Please follow the tutorial [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to convert your markdown file to a snapshot of embeddings that can be imported into a GaiaNet node.
","Q: What version of Node.JS must be installed to use the LlamaParse tool?
A: According to the instructions provided in the LlamaParse tool, it is assumed that you already have Node.JS 20+ installed. However, a more specific version of Node.JS is not specified.

Based on the context and general best practices for Node.JS versions, I would recommend installing at least **Node.JS 14.x** or later to use LlamaParse. This ensures that your system has a recent enough version of Node.JS to support modern JavaScript features and dependencies used in LlamaParse.

Additionally, it's always a good idea to keep your Node.JS installation up-to-date with the latest version (currently Node.JS 16.x or later) for optimal performance and security.

**Bonus Tip:** When installing Node.JS, consider using a package manager like NVM (Node Version Manager) to easily manage multiple versions of Node.JS on your system. This can be especially helpful if you're working with projects that require specific Node.JS versions."

## Create embeddings from the markdown files

Please follow the tutorial [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to convert your markdown file to a snapshot of embeddings that can be imported into a GaiaNet node.
","Q: What is the purpose of the `.env` file when using LlamaParse?
A: The `.env` file in LlamaParse is used to store environment variables that are required for the tool to function properly. Specifically, it is used to set up the path to the PDF file and the LlamaCloud key.

When you run `npx tsx transMd.ts`, the code will look for these environment variables in the `.env` file to determine where to find the PDF file and what credentials to use to authenticate with LlamaCloud.

The purpose of using a `.env` file is to:

1. **Keep sensitive information secure**: By storing sensitive information like API keys and passwords outside of your code, you can avoid committing them to version control.
2. **Make configuration easier**: Instead of hard-coding configuration values into the code, you can store them in a separate file that's easy to update or modify.
3. **Improve portability**: If you need to move or share your project with others, the `.env` file makes it easy to transfer the necessary configuration without exposing sensitive information.

In this case, the `.env` file typically contains variables like:

* `PDF_PATH`: The path to the PDF file you want to parse
* `LLAMA_CLOUD_KEY`: Your LlamaCloud API key

Here's an example of what a `.env` file might look like:
```bash
PDF_PATH=/path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf
LLAMA_CLOUD_KEY=YOUR_LLMACLOUD_API_KEY_HERE
```
Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual values!"

```

The output markdown files called `output.md` will be located in your root directory.

## Create embeddings from the markdown files

Please follow the tutorial [Knowledge base from a markdown file](markdown.md) to convert your markdown file to a snapshot of embeddings that can be imported into a GaiaNet node.
","Q: Where can you find the output markdown file when using GPTPDF?
A: When using GPTPDF, the output markdown file is not saved to a specific location. Instead, it is printed directly to the console.

According to the documentation provided, after running the command `from gptpdf import parse_pdf; api_key = 'Your OpenAI API Key'; content, image_paths = parse_pdf(Your_Pdf_Path, api_key=api_key); print(content)`, the markdown content will be printed to the console.

However, it seems like a mistake in the documentation as GPTPDF does not directly save or return a markdown file. 

If you want to use the output markdown in another process or write it to a file for later use, you would need to manually capture the output or assign it to a variable and then write it to a file using Python's built-in `open` function.

Here is an example of how to do this:

```python
from gptpdf import parse_pdf

api_key = 'Your OpenAI API Key'
content, image_paths = parse_pdf('Your_Pdf_Path', api_key=api_key)

# Write the output markdown to a file called ""output.md""
with open(""output.md"", ""w"") as f:
    f.write(content)
```

In this case, `output.md` will be created in the current working directory with the parsed markdown content. 

**Bonus Tip**: If you're using Jupyter Notebooks or any other interactive environment where output is displayed in the cell, make sure to select the entire output (usually by pressing Ctrl-A) and copy it into a text editor or IDE for easier management and modification of your markdown content."

# Knowledge base from a plain text file

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot from a plain text file. The 
snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

The text file is segmented into multiple chunks by blank lines. [See an example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt). Each chunk is turned into a vector, and when 
retrieved, added to the prompt context for the LLM.

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base. 

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance 
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to chunk a document and create embeddings.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/paragraph_embed/paragraph_embed.wasm
```

It chunks the document based on empty lines. So, you MUST prepare your source document this way -- segment the document into sections of around 200 words with empty lines. You can check out the [Rust source code here](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/paragraph_embed) and modify it if you need to use a different chunking strategy.

> The `paragraph_embed.wasm` program would NOT break up code listings even if there are empty lines with in the listing.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the source document. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from [paris_chunks.txt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt) and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris_chunks.txt -c 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.
* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.txt -c 8192 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

","Summary:
This is a comprehensive guide to creating a vector collection snapshot from a plain text file using Qdrant as the vector database and a pre-trained LLM (large language model) embedding model. The guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to:

1. Install the WasmEdge Runtime and download an embedding model.
2. Start a Qdrant server or use Docker to start one in the background.
3. Create a new collection called ""default"" with 768 dimensions using the `curl` command.
4. Download a program to chunk a document and create embeddings, which is a wasm app that takes a source document, creates chunks, and generates vectors from each chunk using the preloaded embedding model.
5. Run the wasm app to generate the vector collection snapshot, specifying the collection name, vector dimension, and source document.
6. Create an option to specify a context length or start vector ID for the wasm app.
7. Create a vector snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database.

The guide also provides example code and explanations for each step, making it easy to follow along and create your own vector collection snapshot.

Key points:

* Use Qdrant as the vector database.
* Preload an embedding model using WasmEdge.
* Create a new collection with 768 dimensions.
* Download a wasm app to chunk documents and generate vectors.
* Run the wasm app to generate the vector collection snapshot.
* Create options for specifying context length or start vector ID.
* Create a vector snapshot of the collection.

This guide is suitable for anyone interested in creating a knowledge base from a plain text file using Qdrant and LLMs."

# Knowledge base from a plain text file

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot from a plain text file. The 
snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

The text file is segmented into multiple chunks by blank lines. [See an example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt). Each chunk is turned into a vector, and when 
retrieved, added to the prompt context for the LLM.

## Prerequisites

Install the WasmEdge Runtime, the cross-platform LLM runtime.

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s
```

Download an embedding model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base. 

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance 
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to chunk a document and create embeddings.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/paragraph_embed/paragraph_embed.wasm
```

It chunks the document based on empty lines. So, you MUST prepare your source document this way -- segment the document into sections of around 200 words with empty lines. You can check out the [Rust source code here](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/paragraph_embed) and modify it if you need to use a different chunking strategy.

> The `paragraph_embed.wasm` program would NOT break up code listings even if there are empty lines with in the listing.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the source document. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from [paris_chunks.txt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt) and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris_chunks.txt -c 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.
* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.txt -c 8192 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

","Q: How many blank lines segment the text file into chunks?
A: It depends on how the text file is formatted. According to the provided example, [paris_chunks.txt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt), it seems that each chunk is segmented by blank lines.

You can see in the example that there are several sections with empty lines separating them:

```
... text ...
 
...
 
...
 
...
```

The number of blank lines will determine how many chunks are created from the text file. In this case, it appears to be 4-5 chunks separated by blank lines.

However, without knowing the specific formatting of your text file, it's difficult to provide an exact number of blank lines that segment the text into chunks."

","Q: What type of LLM is a special kind of model that turns sentences into vectors?
A: The type of LLM that is a special kind of model that turns sentences into vectors is called an **Embedding Model**.

An Embedding Model is a type of Large Language Model (LLM) that takes text input, such as a sentence or paragraph, and converts it into a numerical vector representation. This vector representation can be thought of as a compact summary of the semantic meaning of the text.

In other words, an Embedding Model maps high-dimensional text data to lower-dimensional vector space, where similar sentences are close together and dissimilar sentences are far apart. This allows for efficient similarity searches and clustering of text data.

Embedding Models like Nomic-embed-text-v1.5, used in this example, are specifically designed for this task and have been pre-trained on large amounts of text data to learn the complex patterns and relationships within language.

**Bonus Tip**: Embedding Models can be used for a wide range of applications beyond knowledge graph construction, such as:

* Text classification
* Information retrieval
* Sentiment analysis
* Clustering and dimensionality reduction

You can experiment with different embedding models and techniques to suit your specific use case!"

The embedding model is a special kind of LLM that turns sentences into vectors. The vectors can then be stored in a vector database and searched later. When the sentences are from a body of text that represents a knowledge domain, that vector database becomes our RAG knowledge base. 

## Start a vector database

By default, we use Qdrant as the vector database. You can start a Qdrant instance 
by [starting a Gaia node with a knowledge snapshot](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

:::note
Or, you can start a Qdrant server using Docker. The following command starts it in the background.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```
:::

## Create the vector collection snapshot

Delete the default collection if it exists.

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

Create a new collection called default. Notice that it is 768 dimensions. That is the output vector size of the embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. If you are using a different embedding model, you should use a dimension that fits the model.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

Download a program to chunk a document and create embeddings.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/paragraph_embed/paragraph_embed.wasm
```

It chunks the document based on empty lines. So, you MUST prepare your source document this way -- segment the document into sections of around 200 words with empty lines. You can check out the [Rust source code here](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/paragraph_embed) and modify it if you need to use a different chunking strategy.

> The `paragraph_embed.wasm` program would NOT break up code listings even if there are empty lines with in the listing.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the source document. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from [paris_chunks.txt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt) and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris_chunks.txt -c 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.
* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.txt -c 8192 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

Have fun!
","Q: How do you start a vector database by default?
A: To start a vector database by default, you can use Gaia node to start it. You can do this by following the [quick-start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) guide.

The quick-start guide will walk you through the process of starting a new Gaia node and selecting the Qdrant as the vector database, which is the default choice.

Alternatively, if you want to use Docker to start a Qdrant server in the background, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

This will start a Qdrant server in the background, which can then be used to create and manage vector collections."

# Knowledge base from a plain text file

In this section, we will discuss how to create a vector collection snapshot from a plain text file. The 
snapshot file can then be [loaded by a Gaia node as its knowledge base](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

The text file is segmented into multiple chunks by blank lines. [See an example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt). Each chunk is turned into a vector, and when 
retrieved, added to the prompt context for the LLM.

","Q: What program chunks a document and creates embeddings to be stored in a vector collection?
A: According to the provided text, the program that chunks a document and creates embeddings is called `paragraph_embed.wasm`. It is a WebAssembly (WASM) program that can be run using the WasmEdge Runtime. 

The `paragraph_embed.wasm` program uses an embedding model to create 768-dimension vectors from the input text. The embedding model is preloaded under the name `embedding` and the dimensions of the output vector is set to match the output size of the embedding model.

You can find more information on how to use the `paragraph_embed.wasm` by following these steps:

1. Download the program using the command: 
   ```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/paragraph_embed/paragraph_embed.wasm
```
2. Run the program with the required arguments, for example:
   ```bash
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris_chunks.txt -c 8192
```
   Here's an explanation of the arguments used:

   * `paragraph_embed.wasm`: The WASM file containing the program.
   * `embedding`: The name under which the embedding model is preloaded.
   * `default`: The name of the collection to store the vectors in.
   * `768`: The dimension size of the output vector (must match the embedding model's output size).
   * `paris_chunks.txt`: The input document to be chunked and embedded.
   * `-c 8192`: Sets the maximum context length.

Note: Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine before running the program."

","Q: What command deletes the default collection if it exists?
A: To delete the default collection if it exists, you need to run the following command:

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default'
```

This will send a DELETE request to Qdrant on port 6333, asking it to remove the default collection from its database.

**Bonus Tip**: You can use the `--output` option with `curl` to print the response status code and body. For example:

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' --output result.txt
```

This will save the response to a file named `result.txt`. The response will contain a JSON object indicating whether the deletion was successful or not.

Example output:
```json
{
  ""error"": null,
  ""message"": ""Collection 'default' has been deleted""
}
```
Or, if the collection does not exist:
```json
{
  ""error"": null,

    }
  }'
```

Download a program to chunk a document and create embeddings.

```
curl -LO https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/raw/main/paragraph_embed/paragraph_embed.wasm
```

It chunks the document based on empty lines. So, you MUST prepare your source document this way -- segment the document into sections of around 200 words with empty lines. You can check out the [Rust source code here](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/embedding-tools/tree/main/paragraph_embed) and modify it if you need to use a different chunking strategy.

> The `paragraph_embed.wasm` program would NOT break up code listings even if there are empty lines with in the listing.

Next, you can run the program by passing a collection name, vector dimension, and the source document. Make sure that Qdrant is running on your local machine. The model is preloaded under the name embedding. The wasm app then uses the embedding model to create the 768-dimension vectors from [paris_chunks.txt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt) and saves them into the default collection.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/paris/raw/main/paris_chunks.txt

wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 paris_chunks.txt -c 8192
```

### Options

You can pass the following options to the program.

* Using `-m` or `--maximum_context_length` to specify a context length in the CLI argument. That is to truncate and warn for each text segment that goes above the context length.
* Using `-s` or `--start_vector_id` to specify the start vector ID in the CLI argument. This will allow us to run this app multiple times on multiple documents on the same vector collection.
* Using `-c` or `--ctx_size` to specify the context size of the input. This defaults to 512.

Example: the above example but to append the London guide to the end of an existing collection starting from index 42.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload embedding:GGML:AUTO:nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
   paragraph_embed.wasm embedding default 768 london.txt -c 8192 -s 42
```

## Create a vector snapshot

You can create a snapshot of the collection, which can be shared and loaded into a different Qdrant database. You can find the snapshot file in the `qdrant_snapshots` directory, or the `~/gaianet/qdrant/snapshots` directory in the Gaia node.

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default/snapshots'
```

We also recommend you to compress the snapshot file.

```
tar czvf my.snapshot.tar.gz my.snapshot
```

Finally, upload the `my.snapshot.tar.gz` file to Huggingface so that the [Gaia node can download and use it](../../node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base).

## Next steps

* [Start](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) a new Gaia node
* [Customize](../../node-guide/customize.md) the Gaia node

Have fun!
","Q: What type of distance is used in the vectors in the Qdrant vector collection?
A: According to the provided instructions, when creating a new collection in Qdrant using the following command:

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    ""vectors"": {
      ""size"": 768,
      ""distance"": ""Cosine"",
      ""on_disk"": true
    }
  }'
```

The distance used in the vectors in the Qdrant vector collection is **Cosine**.

This means that when searching for similar vectors, the cosine similarity metric will be used to calculate the similarity between vectors. This is a common and widely-used similarity measure in vector spaces, which calculates the dot product of two vectors normalized by their magnitudes.

Note that there are other distance metrics available in Qdrant, such as Euclidean, Manhattan (also known as L1), or even more specialized ones like Mahalanobis, depending on the specific use case and requirements."

# Build a knowledge base using Gaia web tool

GaiaNet has developed a tool for making vector collection snapshot files, so everyone can easily create their own knowledge base.

Access it here: https://tools.gaianet.xyz/

## Segment your text file

First, copy unformatted text into a txt file. Then follow the two rules to chunk your content, ie putting similar content together.

- Each title and related content are a chunk. There is no blank lines in one chunk.
- Use a blank line to recognize different chunks.

After that, save it as a txt file.

For example, below is your source.

After formatted, it will look like the following.

```
What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a distributed, cryptographically-secure database structure that allows network participants to establish a trusted and immutable record of transactional data without the need for intermediaries. A blockchain can execute a variety of functions beyond transaction settlement, such as smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital agreements that are embedded in code and can have limitless formats and conditions. Blockchains have proven themselves as superior solutions for securely coordinating data, but they are capable of much more, including tokenization, incentive design, attack-resistance, and reducing counterparty risk. The very first blockchain was the Bitcoin blockchain, which was itself a culmination of over a century of advancements in cryptography and database technology.

What is blockchain software?
Blockchain software is like any other software. The first of its kind was Bitcoin, which was released as open source software, making it available to anyone to use or change. There are a wide variety of efforts across the blockchain ecosystem to improve upon Bitcoin's original software. Ethereum has its own open source blockchain software. Some blockchain software is proprietary and not available to the public.

","Q: Is the web tool for creating a knowledge base open-source?
A: Unfortunately, the web tool for creating a knowledge base provided by Gaianet is not explicitly mentioned as being open-source in the given documentation. However, I can provide some insights based on general information about Gaianet and the web tool.

Gaianet appears to be an organization that focuses on developing AI-powered tools and technologies. Their website and documentation suggest that they use a combination of open-source and proprietary components to build their solutions.

The web tool itself is likely built using a mix of open-source libraries and frameworks, such as Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the exact source code of the web tool is not publicly available, and it's possible that certain components or integrations may be proprietary.

If you're interested in exploring open-source alternatives for building a knowledge base, there are other tools and frameworks available, such as:

1. **Transformers Hub**: A library of pre-trained models from Hugging Face, which can be used to build NLP applications.
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generator)**: An open-source implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generator model, which is used in the Gaianet web tool.
3. **QA-PyTorch**: A PyTorch-based library for building question-answering systems.

Keep in mind that implementing a knowledge base requires significant expertise in NLP, software development, and data curation. If you're new to these areas, it's essential to start with existing open-source solutions or frameworks and gradually build your way up to more complex projects.

**Bonus tip**: When exploring open-source alternatives, be sure to check the licensing terms and conditions for each project. Some licenses may require attribution or impose restrictions on commercial use. Always review the license agreements before integrating third-party code into your project."

","Q: What are the two rules to chunk unformatted text into a txt file?
A: According to the provided context, the two rules to chunk unformatted text into a txt file are:

1. **Each title and related content are a chunk**: This means that all relevant information about a particular topic or question should be grouped together in one section.
2. **Use a blank line to recognize different chunks**: A blank line is used to separate each chunk from the next, indicating that they are distinct topics or questions.

By following these two rules, you can effectively format your unformatted text into a well-structured txt file for use with the Gaia web tool.

**Bonus Tip:** It's essential to be consistent in your formatting and chunking approach to ensure that the tool can accurately process your text. You may want to consider creating a simple template or guidelines to follow when formatting your text, especially if you plan to create multiple knowledge bases using this method."

# Build a knowledge base using Gaia web tool

GaiaNet has developed a tool for making vector collection snapshot files, so everyone can easily create their own knowledge base.

Access it here: https://tools.gaianet.xyz/

## Segment your text file

First, copy unformatted text into a txt file. Then follow the two rules to chunk your content, ie putting similar content together.

- Each title and related content are a chunk. There is no blank lines in one chunk.
- Use a blank line to recognize different chunks.

After that, save it as a txt file.

For example, below is your source.

![The input knowledge in a text file](web_tool_input.png)

After formatted, it will look like the following.

```
What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a distributed, cryptographically-secure database structure that allows network participants to establish a trusted and immutable record of transactional data without the need for intermediaries. A blockchain can execute a variety of functions beyond transaction settlement, such as smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital agreements that are embedded in code and can have limitless formats and conditions. Blockchains have proven themselves as superior solutions for securely coordinating data, but they are capable of much more, including tokenization, incentive design, attack-resistance, and reducing counterparty risk. The very first blockchain was the Bitcoin blockchain, which was itself a culmination of over a century of advancements in cryptography and database technology.

What is blockchain software?
Blockchain software is like any other software. The first of its kind was Bitcoin, which was released as open source software, making it available to anyone to use or change. There are a wide variety of efforts across the blockchain ecosystem to improve upon Bitcoin's original software. Ethereum has its own open source blockchain software. Some blockchain software is proprietary and not available to the public.
```

## Generate the snapshot file

1. Visit this URL: https://tools.gaianet.xyz/, upload the above prepared txt file.
2. Edit your `dbname` . ***Note: Do not include spaces or special characters in the dbname***.
3. Choose Embedding model, we suggest use `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16`.
4. Click the ""Make RAG"" button and wait.

When finished, the chatbot will display GaiaNet Node config info. It is a JSON format as follows.

```
{
  ""embedding"": ""https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf"",
  ""embedding_ctx_size"": 768,
  ""snapshot"": ""https://huggingface.co/datasets/max-id/gaianet-qdrant-snapshot/resolve/main/test/test.snapshot""
}
```

## Update the node config

Run the following

```
gaianet config \
  --snapshot https://huggingface.co/datasets/max-id/gaianet-qdrant-snapshot/resolve/main/test/test.snapshot \
  --embedding-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \

","Q: Are blank lines necessary in chunks of content?
A: No, blank lines are not strictly necessary in chunks of content. According to the rules provided earlier:

* Each title and related content is a chunk.
* There should be no blank lines within one chunk.

This means that if you have a chunk with multiple paragraphs or sentences, they can be grouped together without any blank lines between them. However, it's worth noting that having blank lines can make the text easier to read and understand, especially when working with longer chunks of content.

For example:

```
What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a distributed, cryptographically-secure database structure...
A blockchain can execute a variety of functions beyond transaction settlement...

What is blockchain software?
Blockchain software is like any other software...
The first of its kind was Bitcoin, which was released as open source software.
```

In this example, there are no blank lines within each chunk, but it's still easy to distinguish between the two chunks. If you prefer to use blank lines for clarity, that's also acceptable.

**Bonus tip:** When segmenting your text file, try to keep similar content together in a single chunk. For instance, if you have a list of bullet points or a series of definitions related to a particular topic, consider grouping them all under one title and keeping them as a single chunk. This will make it easier for the Gaia web tool to understand the structure and meaning of your content."

","Q: What happens if you do not separate each title and related content with a blank line?
A: If you do not separate each title and related content with a blank line, the Gaia web tool may struggle to chunk your content correctly. This can lead to several issues:

1. **Incorrect chunking**: The tool might group unrelated content together or split relevant information across multiple chunks.
2. **Loss of context**: Without clear separation between titles and related content, the tool might lose track of which information belongs to which topic, making it difficult to generate accurate embeddings.
3. **Poor performance**: In extreme cases, the tool may not be able to process your data correctly or may take significantly longer to complete its task.

To avoid these issues, it's essential to follow the recommended formatting guidelines:

* Use a blank line to separate each title and related content.
* Ensure there are no blank lines within a chunk (i.e., keep similar content together).

By doing so, you'll help the Gaia web tool understand your data more accurately and generate better embeddings for your knowledge base.

**Bonus tip:** When formatting your text file, use a consistent naming convention for your chunks to make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the structure of your content. For example, you could use headings like ""What is X?"" or ""Benefits of Y"" to clearly indicate the topic and context of each chunk."

A: Yes, each GaiaNet node has the ability to be customized with a fine-tuned model supplemented by domain knowledge. This allows users to create AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise.

**Why is customization important?**

Customization enables GaiaNet nodes to provide more accurate and relevant responses compared to generic models. By leveraging domain knowledge, a node can write SQL code to query SEC 10K filings to respond to user questions in the context of financial analysis, for example.

**How does customization work on GaiaNet?**

To customize a GaiaNet node, users need to follow these steps:

1. **Fine-tune a model**: Users can fine-tune existing language models (LLMs) to suit their specific needs and domains.
2. **Add domain knowledge**: Users can supplement the fine-tuned model with their own domain expertise, such as SQL queries for data analysis or medical terminology for healthcare applications.

By doing so, users can create AI agents that are more specialized and accurate in their responses, reflecting the unique characteristics of a particular industry or expertise.

**Example:** A financial analyst creates a GaiaNet node to provide expert advice on investment strategies. They fine-tune a language model with domain knowledge specific to finance, including data from SEC 10K filings and financial news articles. The resulting AI agent can provide personalized investment recommendations based on the user's financial goals and risk tolerance.

**Bonus Tip:** To get started with customization on GaiaNet, users should explore the documentation on [customizing GaiaNet nodes](./node-guide/customize.md) to learn more about fine-tuning models and adding domain knowledge."

In other words, a GaiaNet domain acts as a gateway or a facade for multiple nodes, allowing users to interact with them in a more unified way. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Scalability**: By distributing requests across multiple nodes, domains can handle a large volume of traffic and ensure that no single node becomes overwhelmed.
2. **Redundancy**: If one node fails or becomes unavailable, the domain can redirect requests to other available nodes, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous service availability.
3. **Centralized management**: Domains provide a single point of management for multiple nodes, making it easier to monitor performance, update configurations, and perform maintenance tasks.

For example, if you want to create an AI-powered customer support system, you could set up a GaiaNet domain specifically for this use case. This domain would contain multiple nodes, each with its own knowledge base and fine-tuned model, but all working together to provide a unified response to customer inquiries.

**Bonus Tip:** When designing a GaiaNet domain, consider implementing techniques like node clustering or queuing systems to optimize resource utilization and ensure efficient request handling."

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person). 

![What is a GaiaNet agent](gaianet_agent.png)

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone. 

Furthermore, LLM agents have entirely different scaling characteristics than past application servers. LLM is extremely computationally intensive. A LLM agent server can typically only serve one user at a time, and it often blocks for seconds at a time. The scaling need is no longer to handle many async requests on a single server, but to load balance among many discrete servers on the internet scale.

The GaiaNet project provides a cross-platform and highly efficient SDK and runtime for finetuned open-source LLMs with proprietary knowledge bases, customized prompts, structured responses, and external tools for function calling. A GaiaNet node can be started in minutes on any personal, cloud, or edge device. It can then offer services through an incentivized web3 network. 

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

**1 Application runtime.** GaiaNet applications run in a lightweight, secure and high-performance sandbox called WasmEdge. As an open-source project managed by the Linux Foundation and CNCF, WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with leading cloud native tools such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman and Kubernetes. It is also the virtual machine of choice by leading public blockchains to securely and efficiently execute on-chain and off-chain smart contracts. 

WasmEdge is a high-performance and cross-platform runtime. It can run AI models on almost all CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators at native speed, making it an ideal runtime for decentralized AI agents.

**2 Finetuned LLM.** The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data. 

The node owner can finetune open-source models using a wide variety of tools. For example, the node owner can finetune an LLM using personal chat histories so that the finetuned LLM can mimic his own speaking style. He can also finetune an LLM to focus it on a specific knowledge domain to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality for questions in that domain. A finetuned LLM can guarantee to output JSON text that matches a pre-determined schema for use with external tools.

Besides LLMs, the node owner could finetune Stable Diffusion models with her own photos to generate images that look like her. 

**3 Embedding model.** The GaiaNet node needs to manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge for the AI agent. It is a key feature that enables the agent to specialize and outperform much larger models in a specific domain.  The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person). 

![What is a GaiaNet agent](gaianet_agent.png)

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone.

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 1. What is the main goal of GaiaNet?
A: The main goal of GaiaNet is to empower individuals and businesses to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, expertise, and domain-specific tasks on a decentralized computing infrastructure.

GaiaNet aims to provide an open-source platform for building, managing, and governing decentralized AI applications, enabling users to create and share their own personalized AI models and services, while ensuring data privacy, security, and ownership.

In summary, GaiaNet's primary objective is to democratize access to AI technology, allowing individuals and businesses to leverage AI capabilities without relying on centralized cloud or SaaS providers."

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person). 

![What is a GaiaNet agent](gaianet_agent.png)

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone. 

Furthermore, LLM agents have entirely different scaling characteristics than past application servers. LLM is extremely computationally intensive. A LLM agent server can typically only serve one user at a time, and it often blocks for seconds at a time. The scaling need is no longer to handle many async requests on a single server, but to load balance among many discrete servers on the internet scale.

The GaiaNet project provides a cross-platform and highly efficient SDK and runtime for finetuned open-source LLMs with proprietary knowledge bases, customized prompts, structured responses, and external tools for function calling. A GaiaNet node can be started in minutes on any personal, cloud, or edge device. It can then offer services through an incentivized web3 network. 

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

**1 Application runtime.** GaiaNet applications run in a lightweight, secure and high-performance sandbox called WasmEdge. As an open-source project managed by the Linux Foundation and CNCF, WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with leading cloud native tools such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman and Kubernetes. It is also the virtual machine of choice by leading public blockchains to securely and efficiently execute on-chain and off-chain smart contracts. 

WasmEdge is a high-performance and cross-platform runtime. It can run AI models on almost all CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators at native speed, making it an ideal runtime for decentralized AI agents.

**2 Finetuned LLM.** The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data. 

The node owner can finetune open-source models using a wide variety of tools. For example, the node owner can finetune an LLM using personal chat histories so that the finetuned LLM can mimic his own speaking style. He can also finetune an LLM to focus it on a specific knowledge domain to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality for questions in that domain. A finetuned LLM can guarantee to output JSON text that matches a pre-determined schema for use with external tools.

Besides LLMs, the node owner could finetune Stable Diffusion models with her own photos to generate images that look like her. 

**3 Embedding model.** The GaiaNet node needs to manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge for the AI agent. It is a key feature that enables the agent to specialize and outperform much larger models in a specific domain.  The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 2. What type of AI agent is described in this text?
A: According to the text, the GaiaNet agent is a type of AI agent that is described as a ""decentralized computing infrastructure"" and an ""autonomous entity capable of completing tasks independently"". This suggests that it is a type of software application that can understand tasks, plan steps, execute actions, handle errors, and deliver results without human intervention.

Specifically, the GaiaNet agent appears to be a:

1. **Decentralized AI agent**: It operates on a decentralized network, allowing multiple nodes to provide services to users.
2. **Autonomous AI agent**: It can perform tasks independently, making decisions based on its programming and data.
3. **Knowledge-based AI agent**: It is designed to interact with knowledge bases, using embeddings and vector databases to retrieve relevant information.

Overall, the GaiaNet agent seems to be a complex, autonomous software system that combines elements of decentralized computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to provide personalized services to users. 

**Bonus Tip:** Decentralized AI agents like GaiaNet have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology, enabling more flexible, adaptable, and human-centered interfaces.

Do you have any follow-up questions or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?"

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face.

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 3. Why are traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure inadequate for emerging AI agent applications?
A: Traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure are inadequate for emerging AI agent applications due to several reasons:

1.  **Customization requirements**: Traditional LLMs, such as GPT-4 or Duet on Gemini, do not offer the ability to customize the model for domain-specific tasks, which is a key requirement for agents.
2.  **Cost structure**: The one-size-fits-all approach of traditional cloud computing and SaaS platforms makes it very expensive to fine-tune or modify any LLMs.
3.  **Private knowledge concerns**: Traditional cloud-hosted LLMs lack proper controls on how the agent's private knowledge might be used and shared, which is a major concern for individual knowledge workers.
4.  **App portability and virtualization**: Traditional SaaS-based infrastructure makes it difficult to transfer applications to other environments due to the restrictive architecture and vendor lock-in.
5.  **Security isolation**: It is challenging to ensure that different tenants on traditional cloud computing platforms do not have access to each other's data, which can be a significant concern for sensitive information.

The unique challenges associated with AI agent applications necessitate a decentralized platform like GaiaNet that offers the necessary tools and infrastructure for individuals and businesses to create and monetize their own LLM agents."

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person). 

![What is a GaiaNet agent](gaianet_agent.png)

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone. 

Furthermore, LLM agents have entirely different scaling characteristics than past application servers. LLM is extremely computationally intensive. A LLM agent server can typically only serve one user at a time, and it often blocks for seconds at a time. The scaling need is no longer to handle many async requests on a single server, but to load balance among many discrete servers on the internet scale.

The GaiaNet project provides a cross-platform and highly efficient SDK and runtime for finetuned open-source LLMs with proprietary knowledge bases, customized prompts, structured responses, and external tools for function calling. A GaiaNet node can be started in minutes on any personal, cloud, or edge device. It can then offer services through an incentivized web3 network. 

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

**1 Application runtime.** GaiaNet applications run in a lightweight, secure and high-performance sandbox called WasmEdge. As an open-source project managed by the Linux Foundation and CNCF, WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with leading cloud native tools such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman and Kubernetes. It is also the virtual machine of choice by leading public blockchains to securely and efficiently execute on-chain and off-chain smart contracts. 

WasmEdge is a high-performance and cross-platform runtime. It can run AI models on almost all CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators at native speed, making it an ideal runtime for decentralized AI agents.

**2 Finetuned LLM.** The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data. 

The node owner can finetune open-source models using a wide variety of tools. For example, the node owner can finetune an LLM using personal chat histories so that the finetuned LLM can mimic his own speaking style. He can also finetune an LLM to focus it on a specific knowledge domain to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality for questions in that domain. A finetuned LLM can guarantee to output JSON text that matches a pre-determined schema for use with external tools.

Besides LLMs, the node owner could finetune Stable Diffusion models with her own photos to generate images that look like her. 

**3 Embedding model.** The GaiaNet node needs to manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge for the AI agent. It is a key feature that enables the agent to specialize and outperform much larger models in a specific domain.  The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone. 

Furthermore, LLM agents have entirely different scaling characteristics than past application servers. LLM is extremely computationally intensive. A LLM agent server can typically only serve one user at a time, and it often blocks for seconds at a time. The scaling need is no longer to handle many async requests on a single server, but to load balance among many discrete servers on the internet scale.

The GaiaNet project provides a cross-platform and highly efficient SDK and runtime for finetuned open-source LLMs with proprietary knowledge bases, customized prompts, structured responses, and external tools for function calling. A GaiaNet node can be started in minutes on any personal, cloud, or edge device. It can then offer services through an incentivized web3 network. 

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

**1 Application runtime.** GaiaNet applications run in a lightweight, secure and high-performance sandbox called WasmEdge. As an open-source project managed by the Linux Foundation and CNCF, WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with leading cloud native tools such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman and Kubernetes. It is also the virtual machine of choice by leading public blockchains to securely and efficiently execute on-chain and off-chain smart contracts. 

WasmEdge is a high-performance and cross-platform runtime. It can run AI models on almost all CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators at native speed, making it an ideal runtime for decentralized AI agents.

**2 Finetuned LLM.** The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data. 

The node owner can finetune open-source models using a wide variety of tools. For example, the node owner can finetune an LLM using personal chat histories so that the finetuned LLM can mimic his own speaking style. He can also finetune an LLM to focus it on a specific knowledge domain to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality for questions in that domain. A finetuned LLM can guarantee to output JSON text that matches a pre-determined schema for use with external tools.

Besides LLMs, the node owner could finetune Stable Diffusion models with her own photos to generate images that look like her. 

**3 Embedding model.** The GaiaNet node needs to manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge for the AI agent. It is a key feature that enables the agent to specialize and outperform much larger models in a specific domain.  The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person).

* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 6. What is the purpose of a ""prompt"" in the context of GaiaNet?
A: **Purpose of a ""prompt"" in GaiaNet:**

In the context of GaiaNet, a **prompt** is a sequence of text that serves as input to a Large Language Model (LLM) to guide its response generation. The purpose of a prompt is to:

1.  **Contextualize the question**: Provide relevant information or context for the LLM to answer the user's question accurately.
2.  **Define the task**: Specify what action the LLM should perform, such as generating text, summarizing content, or answering a specific type of question.
3.  **Set the tone and style**: Influence the tone, style, and voice of the LLM's response to match the desired persona or language.

**Types of prompts:**

GaiaNet supports various types of prompts, including:

*   **System prompts**: General introductions to the agent task, often containing a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone.
*   **RAG (Relevant Answer Generation) prompts**: Prefixes added to knowledge base search results in an RAG chat, encouraging the LLM to answer based on facts and opinions within the context.

**Dynamic prompt generation:**

The GaiaNet node allows developers to customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation. This enables the creation of complex prompts that adapt to different user inputs or contexts.

In summary, prompts play a crucial role in guiding the LLM's response generation process and ensuring accurate and relevant answers in GaiaNet-based applications.


**Example use cases:**

1.  **Chatbot development**: Use prompts to create engaging chatbots with diverse personalities and voices.
2.  **Content summarization**: Develop LLMs that summarize long texts or articles based on specific prompts.
3.  **Question answering**: Design prompts for question-answering systems that address specific topics or domains.

By leveraging the power of prompts, developers can unlock innovative applications and improve the overall user experience in GaiaNet-based solutions."

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person). 

![What is a GaiaNet agent](gaianet_agent.png)

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone. 

Furthermore, LLM agents have entirely different scaling characteristics than past application servers. LLM is extremely computationally intensive. A LLM agent server can typically only serve one user at a time, and it often blocks for seconds at a time. The scaling need is no longer to handle many async requests on a single server, but to load balance among many discrete servers on the internet scale.

The GaiaNet project provides a cross-platform and highly efficient SDK and runtime for finetuned open-source LLMs with proprietary knowledge bases, customized prompts, structured responses, and external tools for function calling. A GaiaNet node can be started in minutes on any personal, cloud, or edge device. It can then offer services through an incentivized web3 network. 

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

**1 Application runtime.** GaiaNet applications run in a lightweight, secure and high-performance sandbox called WasmEdge. As an open-source project managed by the Linux Foundation and CNCF, WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with leading cloud native tools such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman and Kubernetes. It is also the virtual machine of choice by leading public blockchains to securely and efficiently execute on-chain and off-chain smart contracts. 

WasmEdge is a high-performance and cross-platform runtime. It can run AI models on almost all CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators at native speed, making it an ideal runtime for decentralized AI agents.

**2 Finetuned LLM.** The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data. 

The node owner can finetune open-source models using a wide variety of tools. For example, the node owner can finetune an LLM using personal chat histories so that the finetuned LLM can mimic his own speaking style. He can also finetune an LLM to focus it on a specific knowledge domain to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality for questions in that domain. A finetuned LLM can guarantee to output JSON text that matches a pre-determined schema for use with external tools.

Besides LLMs, the node owner could finetune Stable Diffusion models with her own photos to generate images that look like her. 

**3 Embedding model.** The GaiaNet node needs to manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge for the AI agent. It is a key feature that enables the agent to specialize and outperform much larger models in a specific domain.  The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 7. How do GaiaNet nodes scale to handle multiple requests from users?
A: **GaiaNet Node Scaling**

In GaiaNet, each node is designed to handle a single request from a user at a time. However, scaling to multiple requests is crucial for providing public services. To achieve this, we use load balancing and the concept of domains.

### Load Balancing

The load balancer distributes incoming requests across available nodes in the domain. It directs each user's request to an active node that has sufficient resources to handle it. This ensures efficient use of system resources and prevents a single node from becoming overwhelmed by a large number of requests.

### Domain Architecture

A GaiaNet domain is a collection of registered nodes under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator is responsible for:

* Verifying and admitting individual nodes to the domain
* Monitoring each node's performance at real time and removing inactive ones
* Promoting the ""teaching assistant"" chatbot apps to the target audience
* Setting the price for API services

Each GaiaNet node has a unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. Once registered with a domain, nodes can receive payments from both service revenue and network awards.

### Load Balancing Strategies

To ensure efficient load balancing across available nodes:

1.  **Round Robin**: The load balancer directs incoming requests to each node in a sequence (Node A, Node B, Node C, ...).
2.  **Least Connection**: Incoming requests are directed to the node with the fewest active connections.
3.  **IP Hash**: Each user's IP address is hashed and mapped to a specific node for all subsequent requests.

### Conclusion

GaiaNet nodes use load balancing and domain architecture to scale efficiently in handling multiple requests from users. By distributing incoming requests across available nodes, we ensure that no single node becomes overwhelmed and that system resources are utilized effectively.

**Bonus Tip:**

For optimal performance, consider implementing a hybrid load balancing approach combining the above strategies or adding more sophisticated techniques such as:

*   **Geographic Routing**: routing based on geographical locations to reduce latency
*   **Session Persistence**: ensuring subsequent requests from the same user go to the same node
*   **Server Clustering**: grouping nodes with similar resources for efficient resource utilization"

The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 8. What is the relationship between a GaiaNet domain and its nodes?
A: A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes that are registered and managed under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes their services available to the public.

In other words, a GaiaNet node is a part of a larger GaiaNet domain. A node is a individual entity within the domain, and it provides its own unique set of AI agent services to users through the domain's API.

The relationship between a GaiaNet domain and its nodes can be described as follows:

* **Registration**: Node operators register their nodes with a GaiaNet domain.
* **Verification**: The domain operator verifies the node's identity, functionality, and performance before allowing it to join the domain.
* **Management**: The domain operator has control over which nodes are registered under the domain and can manage the services offered by those nodes.
* **Load balancing**: The domain operator load-balances incoming requests between active nodes within the domain.
* **Revenue sharing**: The domain operator pays a share of revenue to node operators who provide services through the domain.

In summary, a GaiaNet domain is a collection of registered nodes that work together to provide AI agent services to users, and each node contributes its own unique capabilities and services to the domain."

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person). 

![What is a GaiaNet agent](gaianet_agent.png)

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone. 

Furthermore, LLM agents have entirely different scaling characteristics than past application servers. LLM is extremely computationally intensive. A LLM agent server can typically only serve one user at a time, and it often blocks for seconds at a time. The scaling need is no longer to handle many async requests on a single server, but to load balance among many discrete servers on the internet scale.

The GaiaNet project provides a cross-platform and highly efficient SDK and runtime for finetuned open-source LLMs with proprietary knowledge bases, customized prompts, structured responses, and external tools for function calling. A GaiaNet node can be started in minutes on any personal, cloud, or edge device. It can then offer services through an incentivized web3 network. 

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

**1 Application runtime.** GaiaNet applications run in a lightweight, secure and high-performance sandbox called WasmEdge. As an open-source project managed by the Linux Foundation and CNCF, WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with leading cloud native tools such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman and Kubernetes. It is also the virtual machine of choice by leading public blockchains to securely and efficiently execute on-chain and off-chain smart contracts. 

WasmEdge is a high-performance and cross-platform runtime. It can run AI models on almost all CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators at native speed, making it an ideal runtime for decentralized AI agents.

**2 Finetuned LLM.** The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data. 

The node owner can finetune open-source models using a wide variety of tools. For example, the node owner can finetune an LLM using personal chat histories so that the finetuned LLM can mimic his own speaking style. He can also finetune an LLM to focus it on a specific knowledge domain to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality for questions in that domain. A finetuned LLM can guarantee to output JSON text that matches a pre-determined schema for use with external tools.

Besides LLMs, the node owner could finetune Stable Diffusion models with her own photos to generate images that look like her. 

**3 Embedding model.** The GaiaNet node needs to manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge for the AI agent. It is a key feature that enables the agent to specialize and outperform much larger models in a specific domain.  The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation.

It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.

A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide.

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 9. How are payments processed in the GaiaNet network?
A: **Payment Processing in the GaiaNet Network**

In the GaiaNet network, payments are processed through a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms. Here's an overview of how it works:

1.  **Access Token**: When a user pays into the smart contract associated with a GaiaNet domain, an access token is automatically issued to them.
2.  **Token-based Payments**: The user uses this access token to make API calls to the domain, which are then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes services, their fund in the contract depletes, and the access token stops working if they no longer have any balance.

**Payment Denominations**

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator and typically denominated in USD stablecoins. The revenue share for node operators is also a portion of this payment.

**Payment Cycles**

Payments in the GaiaNet network occur on a per-cycle basis. Each cycle represents a period during which services are consumed, and payments are made to nodes within that domain. This allows for more efficient and flexible pricing models.

**Example**

For example, let's say a user has 10 tokens, each valued at $1, making their balance $10. They make an API call to the domain using one of these tokens. The token is then removed from their balance, leaving them with 9 remaining tokens and a new balance of $9.

**Tokens as a Payment Utility**

The GaiaNet token serves as a payment utility in the network, allowing users to pay for services over time. Its value is determined based on real-time exchange rates when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract. This helps maintain a balance between supply and demand within the network.

**Network Benefits**

The payment processing mechanism in the GaiaNet network offers several benefits, including:

*   **Token-based Payment Flexibility**: Allowing users to make payments using tokens, which can be more efficient than traditional payment methods.
*   **Revenue Share for Node Operators**: Ensuring that node operators receive a fair share of revenue generated by their services.

This system enables the GaiaNet network to provide a secure and efficient payment processing mechanism for its users."

# GaiaNet: GenAI Agent Network

## Abstract

Specialized, finetuned and RAG-enhanced open-source Large Language Models are key elements in emerging AI agent applications. However, those agent apps also present unique challenges to the traditional cloud computing and SaaS infrastructure, including new requirements for application portability, virtualization, security isolation, costs, data privacy, and ownership. 

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services. 

## Introduction

The emergence of ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized how humans produce and consume knowledge. Within a year, AI-native applications have evolved from chatbots to copilots, to agents.

> AI agents would increasingly evolve from supportive tools (akin to Copilots) to autonomous entities capable of completing tasks independently. — Dr. Andrew Ng at Sequoia Capital AI Ascent 2024 Summit

Agents are software applications that can complete tasks on its own autonomously like a human. The agent can understand the task, plan the steps to complete the task, execute all the steps, handle errors and exceptions, and deliver the results. While a powerful LLM could act as the “brain” for the agent, we need to connect to external data sources (eyes and ears), domain-specific knowledge base and prompts (skills), context stores (memory), and external tools (hands). For agent tasks, we often need to customize the LLM itself 

* to reduce hallucinations in a specific domain. 
* to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., a JSON schema). 
* to answer “politically incorrect” questions (e.g., to analyze CVE exploits for an agent in the security domain). 
* and to answer requests in a specific style (e.g., to mimic a person). 

![What is a GaiaNet agent](gaianet_agent.png)

Agents are complex software that require significant amount of engineering and resources. Today, most agents are close-source and hosted on SaaS-based LLMs. Popular examples include GPTs and Microsoft/GitHub copilots on OpenAI LLMs, and Duet on Google’s Gemini LLMs. 

However, as we discussed, a key requirement for agents is to customize and adapt its underlying LLM and software stack for domain-specific tasks — an area where centralized SaaS perform very poorly. For example, with ChatGPT, every small task must be handled by a very large model. It is also enormously expensive to fine-tune or modify any ChatGPT models. The one-size-fits-all LLMs are detrimental to the agent use case in capabilities, alignment, and cost structure. Furthermore, the SaaS hosted LLMs lack privacy controls on how the agent’s private knowledge might be used and shared. Because of these shortcomings, it is difficult for individual knowledge workers to create and monetize agents for his or her own domain and tasks on SaaS platforms like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and AWS. 

In this paper, we propose a decentralized software platform and protocol network for AI agents for everyone. Specifically, our goals are two-folds. 

**Goal #1:** Empower individuals to incorporate his/her private knowledge and expertise into personal LLM agent apps. Those apps aim to perform knowledge tasks and use tools just as the individual would, but also reflect the individual’s style and values.

**Goal #2:** Enable individuals to provide and scale their LLM agents as services, and get compensated for their expertise and work.

> GaiaNet is “YouTube for knowledge and skills.”

## Open-source and decentralization

As of April 2024, there are over 6000 open-source LLMs published on Hugging face. Compared with close-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, open-source LLMs offer advantages in privacy, cost, and systematic bias. Even with general QA performance, open-source LLMs are closing the gap with close-source counterparties quickly. 

![Open vs close source LLMs](closed_vs_open.jpg)

For AI agent use cases, it has been demonstrated that smaller but task-specific LLMs often outperform larger general models. 

However, it is difficult for individuals and businesses to deploy and orchestrate multiple finetuned LLMs on their own heterogeneous GPU infrastructure. The complex software stack for agents, as well as the complex interaction with external tools, are fragile and error-prone. 

Furthermore, LLM agents have entirely different scaling characteristics than past application servers. LLM is extremely computationally intensive. A LLM agent server can typically only serve one user at a time, and it often blocks for seconds at a time. The scaling need is no longer to handle many async requests on a single server, but to load balance among many discrete servers on the internet scale.

The GaiaNet project provides a cross-platform and highly efficient SDK and runtime for finetuned open-source LLMs with proprietary knowledge bases, customized prompts, structured responses, and external tools for function calling. A GaiaNet node can be started in minutes on any personal, cloud, or edge device. It can then offer services through an incentivized web3 network. 

## GaiaNet node

The basic operational unit in the GaiaNet network is a node. A GaiaNet node is a streamlined software stack that allows any technically competent person to run an AI agent of his own. The software stack on the GaiaNet node consists of the following 7 key components.

![GaiaNet node architecture](gaianet_node.png)

**1 Application runtime.** GaiaNet applications run in a lightweight, secure and high-performance sandbox called WasmEdge. As an open-source project managed by the Linux Foundation and CNCF, WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with leading cloud native tools such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman and Kubernetes. It is also the virtual machine of choice by leading public blockchains to securely and efficiently execute on-chain and off-chain smart contracts. 

WasmEdge is a high-performance and cross-platform runtime. It can run AI models on almost all CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators at native speed, making it an ideal runtime for decentralized AI agents.

**2 Finetuned LLM.** The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data. 

The node owner can finetune open-source models using a wide variety of tools. For example, the node owner can finetune an LLM using personal chat histories so that the finetuned LLM can mimic his own speaking style. He can also finetune an LLM to focus it on a specific knowledge domain to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality for questions in that domain. A finetuned LLM can guarantee to output JSON text that matches a pre-determined schema for use with external tools.

Besides LLMs, the node owner could finetune Stable Diffusion models with her own photos to generate images that look like her. 

**3 Embedding model.** The GaiaNet node needs to manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge for the AI agent. It is a key feature that enables the agent to specialize and outperform much larger models in a specific domain.  The embedding models are specially trained LLMs that turns input sentences into a vector representation, instead of generating completions. Since the embedding models are trained from LLMs, they can “embed” the “meaning” of the sentences into the vectors so that similar sentences are located close together in the high dimensional space occupied by those vectors.

With the embedding model, a GaiaNet node can ingest a body of text, images, PDFs, web links, audio and video files, and generate a collection of embedding vectors based on their contents. The embedding model also turns user questions and conversations into vectors, which allows the GaiaNet node to quickly identify contents in its knowledge base that are relevant to the current conversation. 

**4 Vector database.** The embedding vectors that form GaiaNet node’s knowledge base are stored on the node itself for optimal performance and maximum privacy. The GaiaNet node includes a Qdrant vector database. 

**5 Custom prompts.** Besides finetuning and knowledge arguments, the easiest way to customize an LLM for new applications is simply to prompt it. Like humans, LLMs are remarkable one-shot learners. You can simply give it an example of how to accomplish a task, and it will learn and do similar tasks on its own. Prompt engineering is a practical field to research and develop such prompts.

Furthermore, effective prompts could be highly dependent on the model in use. A prompt that works well for a large model, such as Mixtral 8x22b, is probably not going to work well for a small model like Mistral 7b.

The GaiaNet node can support several different prompts that are dynamically chosen and used in applications. For example,

* The `system_prompt` is a general introduction to the agent task the node is supposed to perform. It often contains a persona to help the LLM respond with the right tone. For example, the `system_prompt` for a college teaching assistant could be: “You are a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley’s computer science 101 class. Please explain concepts and answer questions in detail. Do not answer any question that is not related to math or computer science.”
* The `rag_prompt` is a prefix prompt to be dynamically inserted in front of knowledge base search results in an RAG chat. It could be something like this: “Please answer the question based on facts and opinions in the context below. Do not make anything that is not in the context. ---------”

The LLM community has developed many useful prompts for different application use cases. GaiaNet node allows you to easily manage and experiment with them. 

Through the our developer SDK, GaiaNet owners and operators could customize the logic of dynamic prompt generation in their own way. For example, a GaiaNet node could perform a Google search for any user question, and add the search results into the prompt as context.

**6 Function calls and tool use.** The LLM not only is great at generating human language, but also excels at generating machine instructions. Through finetuning and prompt engineering, we could get some LLMs to consistently generate structured JSON objects or computer code in many language tasks, such as summarizing and extracting key elements from a paragraph of text.

The GaiaNet node allows you to specify the output format of the generated text. You can give it a grammar specification file to enforce that responses will always conform to a pre-defined JSON schema.

Once the LLM returns a structured JSON response, the agent typically need to pass the JSON to a tool that performs the task and comes back with an answer. For example, the user question might be. 

```
What is the weather like in Singapore?
```

The LLM generates the following JSON response. 

```
{""tool"":""get_current_weather"", ""location"":""Singapore"",""unit"":""celsius""}
```

The GaiaNet node must know what is the tool associated with get_current_weather and then invoke it. GaiaNet node owners and operators can configure any number of external tools by mapping a tool name with a web service endpoint. In the above example, the get_current_weather tool might be associated with a web service that takes this JSON data. The GaiaNet node sends the JSON to the web service endpoint via HTTPS POST and receives an answer. 

```
42
```

It then optionally feeds the answer to the LLM to generate a human language answer. 

```
The current weather in Singapore is 42C. 
```

Through the GaiaNet node SDK, developers are not limited to using web services. They can write plugins to process LLM responses locally on the node. For example, the LLM might return Python code, which can be executed locally in a sandbox and for the GaiaNet node to perform a complex operation. 

**7 The API server.** All GaiaNet nodes must have the same API for questions and answers. That allows front-end applications to work with, and potentially be load-balanced to any GaiaNet node. We choose to support the OpenAI API specification, which enables GaiaNet nodes to become drop-in replacements for OpenAI API endpoints for a large ecosystem of applications.

The API server runs securely and cross-platform on the WasmEdge runtime. It ties together all the other components in the GaiaNet node. It receives user requests, generates an embedding from the request, searches the vector database, adds search results to the prompt context, generates an LLM response, and then optionally uses the response to perform function calling. The API server also provides a web-based chatbot UI for users to chat with the RAG-enhanced finetuned LLM on the node.

## GaiaNet network

While each GaiaNet node is already a powerful AI agent capable of answering complex questions and performing actions, individual nodes are not suitable for providing public services. There are several important reasons.

* For the public consumers and users, it is very hard to judge the trustworthiness of individual GaiaNet nodes. Harmful misinformation could be spread by malicious node operators.
* For GaiaNet node owners and operators, there is no economic incentive to provide such services to the public, which could be very costly to run.
* The AI agent servers have very different scaling characteristics than traditional internet application servers. When the agent is processing a user request, it typically takes up all the computing resources on the hardware. Instead of using software to scale concurrent users on a single server, the challenge of GaiaNet is to scale to many different identical nodes for a large application. 

Those challenges have given rise to the GaiaNet domain, which forms the basis of the GaiaNet web3 network. A GaiaNet domain is a collection of GaiaNet nodes available under a single Internet domain name. The domain operator decides which GaiaNet nodes can be registered under the domain and makes the node services available to the public. For example, a GaiaNet domain might be a Computer Science teaching assistant for UC Berkeley. The domain could provide services through `https://cs101.gaianet.berkeley.edu`. The domain operator needs to do the following. 

* Verify and admit individual nodes to be registered under the domain. Those nodes must all meet requirements, such as the LLM, knowledge base, and prompts, set by the domain operator to ensure service quality. The node registration on a domain could be done via a whitelist or blacklist. It is up to the domain operator.
* Monitor each node’s performance at real time and remove inactive ones.
* Promotes the “teaching assistant” chatbot apps to the target audience.
* Set the price for the API services. 
* Load balance between active nodes.
* Getting paid by users. 
* Pay nodes for their services.

![GaiaNet network architecture](gaianet_eco.png)

Each GaiaNet node has an unique node ID in the form of an ETH address. The private key associated with the ETH address is stored on the node. Once a node is successfully registered with a domain, it is entitled to receive payments from both service revenue and network awards from the domain. The domain could send payments directly to the node's ETH address. Or, the domain could provide a mechanism for a node operator to register multiple nodes under a single Metamask address, such as signing a challenge phrase using the node private keys. In that case, the node operator will receive aggregated payments in his Metamask account for all associated nodes.

Each GaiaNet domain has an associated smart contract that is used for escrow payments. It is similar to OpenAI’s credit payment model, where users purchase credits first, and then consume them over time. When the user pays into the smart contract, an access token will be automatically issued to him. He uses this token to make API calls to the domain, which is then load-balanced to random nodes in the domain. As the user consumes those services, his fund in the contract depletes and the access token stops working if he no longer has any balance. 

The pricing and payment of the API service are determined by the domain operator. It is typically denominated in USD stable coins. The domain operator pays a share of the revenue to node operators who provided the services. The GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace of agent services.

> The funds locked in GaiaNet domain contracts are for a single purpose of consuming API services. It is called Purpose Bound Money. 

A key aspect of the GaiaNet protocol is that the domain operators are “trust providers” in the ecosystem of decentralized nodes. The protocol network is designed to incentivize the trust of the operators through tokenomics designs such as mining and staking. GaiaNet nodes, domains, users, and developers form a DAO to grow the network and benefit all contributors.

## GaiaNet token

The GaiaNet token is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions, support governance, and foster trust in the network. It serves three primary purposes.

* As a DAO governance token, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
* As a staking token, holders vouch for domain operators’ trustworthiness. Stakers get a cut from the domain operator’s service revenue. But they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehave, such as spreading misinformation or providing unreliable services.
* As a payment token, the GaiaNet token could be deposited into the domain’s escrow contract and be used to pay for services over time. 

The payment utility of the GaiaNet token is designed to balance the network supply and demand. The value of the GaiaNet token asset is determined at the time when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract based on real-time exchange rates.

Service consumers could lock in savings from the potential appreciation of the token. For example, if a user deposits $100 worth of GaiaNet tokens into the contract, and when the domain and nodes get paid, the token value has gone up to $110, he would have received $110 worth of agent services. 

Conversely, if the token price drops, the service providers (domains and nodes) now have an opportunity to “mine” the tokens on the cheap. If the $100 initial tokens is only worth $90 now, service providers will get more tokens for each unit of electricity and compute they provide. That incentivizes more nodes to join the network and speculate on a later rise in token value.

> An exercise: OpenAI is projected to reach $5 billion in ARR in 2024. Assume that most enterprise customers pay quarterly, that is $1.25 billion of circulation market cap in addition to OpenAI’s current enterprise value if they were to issue a payment token. The overall AI services market size is projected to reach $2 trillion in a few years. That translates to $500 billion market cap for a payment utility token alone. 

## Component marketplace for AI assets

GaiaNet is a developer platform to create your agent services. We provide tools for you to do these. 

* Tools to generate finetuning datasets and perform finetuning on CPU and GPU machines.
* Tools to ingest documents and create vector embeddings for the knowledge base. 
* Rust-based SDK to dynamically generate and manage prompts. 
* Rust-based SDK to extend the agent’s capability for invoking tools and software on the node.

For developers who do not wish to operate nodes, we are building a marketplace for 

* finetuned models
* knowledge bases and datasets
* function-calling plugins

All those components are blockchain-based assets represented by NFTs. A node operator could purchase NFTs for the components it wishes to use, and share service revenue with the component developers. That enables diverse and cashflow-generating assets to be issued from the GaiaNet ecosystem.

## Conclusion

GaiaNet provides open-source tools for individuals and teams to create agent services using their proprietary knowledge and skills. Developers could create finetuned LLMs, knowledge collections, and plugins for the agent, and issue assets based on those components. The GaiaNet protocol makes those nodes discoverable and accessible through GaiaNet domains.


","Q: 10. What utility does the GaiaNet token serve?
A: According to the text, the GaiaNet token serves three primary purposes:

1. **As a DAO governance token**, holders can participate in setting the rules of the network.
2. **As a staking token**, holders vouch for domain operators' trustworthiness and receive a cut from the service revenue. However, they could also be slashed if the domain operator misbehaves.
3. **As a payment token**, it can be deposited into the domain's escrow contract and used to pay for services over time.

In addition to these purposes, the GaiaNet token also has utility in terms of providing a balance between network supply and demand, as its value is determined by real-time exchange rates when it enters or leaves the escrow smart contract."

1. **Changing the chat model**:

You can change the chat model by updating the `--chat-url` option in the `config.json` file or by using the `gaianet config --chat-url <url>` command. For example, you can update the chat model to a new version of LLaMA.

```
{
    ...
    ""chat_model"": {
        ""model_name"": ""gemma-1.1-2b-it"",
        ""download_url"": ""https://huggingface.co/gaianet/gemma-1.1-2b-it-GGUF/resolve/main/gemma-1.1-2b-it-Q5_K_M.gguf""
    }
}
```

Or, you can use the `gaianet config` command:

```bash
gaianet config --chat-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/gemma-1.1-2b-it-GGUF/resolve/main/gemma-1.1-2b-it-Q5_K_M.gguf
```

2. **Changing the prompt template**:

You can change the prompt template by updating the `--prompt-template` option in the `config.json` file or by using the `gaianet config --prompt-template <template>` command.

For example, you can update the prompt template to a new template named ""gemma-chat"".

```
{
    ...
    ""chat_model"": {
        ...
        ""prompt_template"": ""gemma-chat""
    }
}
```

Or, you can use the `gaianet config` command:

```bash
gaianet config --prompt-template gemma-chat
```

3. **Changing the context size**:

You can change the context size by updating the `--chat-ctx-size` or `--embedding-ctx-size` option in the `config.json` file or by using the `gaianet config --chat-ctx-size <size>` and `gaianet config --embedding-ctx-size <size>` commands.

For example, you can update the context size of the chat model to 4096 words:

```
{
    ...
    ""chat_model"": {
        ...
        ""context_size"": 4096
    }
}
```

Or, you can use the `gaianet config` command:

```bash
gaianet config --chat-ctx-size 4096
```

4. **Changing the port**:

You can change the port by updating the `--port` option in the `config.json` file or by using the `gaianet config --port <port>` command.

For example, you can update the port to 8000:

```bash
{
    ...
    ""port"": 8000
}
```

Or, you can use the `gaianet config` command:

```bash
gaianet config --port 8000
```

5. **Customizing system prompts**:

You can customize system prompts by updating the `--system-prompt` option in the `config.json` file or by using the `gaianet config --system-prompt ""<prompt>""` command.

For example, you can update the system prompt to a new prompt:

```
{
    ...
    ""system_prompt"": ""Please provide your input:""
}
```

Or, you can use the `gaianet config` command:

```bash
gaianet config --system-prompt ""Please provide your input:""
```

6. **Customizing RAG prompts**:

You can customize RAG prompts by updating the `--rag-prompt` option in the `config.json` file or by using the `gaianet config --rag-prompt ""<prompt>""` command.

For example, you can update the RAG prompt to a new prompt:

```
{
    ...
    ""rag_prompt"": ""Please provide your input for the reasoning task:""
}
```

Or, you can use the `gaianet config` command:

```bash
gaianet config --rag-prompt ""Please provide your input for the reasoning task:""
```

7. **Customizing reverse prompts**:

You can customize reverse prompts by updating the `--reverse-prompt` option in the `config.json` file or by using the `gaianet config --reverse-prompt ""<prompt>""` command.

For example, you can update the reverse prompt to a new prompt:

```
{
    ...
    ""reverse_prompt"": ""Please provide your input for the reverse task:""
}
```

Or, you can use the `gaianet config` command:

```bash
gaianet config --reverse-prompt ""Please provide your input for the reverse task:""
```

After updating the settings using `gaianet config`, remember to run `gaianet init` and `gaianet start` to apply the changes."

[+] Updating the prompt template of chat model ...
    * Old template: llama-3-chat
    * New template: gemma-chat

[+] COMPLETED! The config.json is updated successfully.
```

## base

The `--base` option is global. You can combine it with other subcommands to specify a base directory for the GaiaNet node other than the `$HOME/gaianet`.

","Q: What is the default port of the GaiaNet node API server?
A: According to the context, the default port of the GaiaNet node API server can be changed using the `gaianet config` command with the `--port <port>` option. However, it does not explicitly mention the default port.

But, based on general conventions, a commonly used default port for API servers is 3000 or 8080.

If you want to check your current GaiaNet configuration, you can use the `gaianet config` command without any options:

```
gaianet config
```

This will display all the key fields defined in the `config.json` file, including the port number if it has been changed from the default.

If you want to change the default port for your GaiaNet node API server, you can use the following command:

```
gaianet config --port <new_port>
```

Replace `<new_port>` with your desired port number. For example, to set the port to 8080:

```
gaianet config --port 8080
```"

# Customize Your GaiaNet Node

A key goal of the GaiaNet project is to enable each individual to create and run his or her own
agent service node using finetuned LLMs and proprietary knowledge. In all likelihood, 
you are not going to run a node with the [default](quick-start.md) Phi-3 LLM and Paris guidebook knowledge base.
In this chapter, we will discuss ways to customize your node.

## Pre-set configurations

All the node configuration options, such as LLM settings, vector collection for the knowledge base, and prompts, 
are all in the `gaianet/config.json` file. You can edit this file directly to use your models and vector collections.
Or, you can select a different `config.json` when you initialize the node. Just pass in a URL to the `config.json` file 
in your `gaianet init` command.
We have several pre-set `config.json` files to choose from [in this repo](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs).
For example, the following command initialize a GaiaNet node with a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

> The URL to the `config.json` must point to the actual text file. (i.e., the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL for GitHub links) instead of the GitHub HTML page for that file.

## The config subcommand

After you have initialized the node, you can still make changes to its configuration by editing the `config.json` file
directly. But it is easier and safer to use the `gaianet` CLI to make changes.

> You MUST run `gaianet init` again after you make any changes to the node configuration.

The following command shows the `config.json` fields you can make changes to.

```
gaianet config list
```

Now, let's look at some examples.

### Select an LLM

There are over 10,000 finetuned open-source LLMs you can choose from on Huggingface. They each have different sizes (larger models are more capable but more expensive to run), unique capabilities (e.g., uncensored, to excel in math or reasoning, to support large context length etc), domain expertise (e.g., medicine, coding), and / or styles (e.g., to speak like a teacher or a pirate, to respond in code, to follow conversations).

To replace GaiaNet node's default LLM with an alternative
finetuned model, you will need to make changes to the model file, prompt template, and model context length parameters.
Those parameters vary depending on the model, but they can be found on the [GaiaNet Huggingface organization's](https://huggingface.co/gaianet) model cards. For example, the following command changes the LLM to a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet config \
  --chat-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --chat-ctx-size 4096 \
  --prompt-template llama-3-chat 
```

> The llama 3 8B model requires at least 16GB of RAM.

If none of the published finetuned models are perfect for your use case, you can also finetune your own LLM by following [these guides](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md). Your GaiaNet node can run your own finetuned models. 

> The `--chat-url` argument could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file.

### Select a knowledge base

A key feature of GaiaNet is that users can create and deploy proprietary knowledge base on the node to supplement
the LLM. Each knowledge base is a snapshot file for a vector collection. 
We encourage you to [create your own knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md). But you can also use 
ready-made knowledge bases. You will need to do the following.

* specify the URL to the vector collection (i.e., the `snapshot` or `snapshot.tar.gz` file) in the `snapshot` option.
* use the same embedding model that generated this vector collection.
* modify the `system_prompt` to give the model background knowledge.
* modify the `rag_prompt` to instruct the model to answer the question when context is retrieved from the vector collection.

The following example changes the knowledge base in the node from ""Paris guidebook"" to ""London guidebook"". 

```
gaianet config \
  --snapshot https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/london/resolve/main/london_768_nomic-embed-text-v1.5-f16.snapshot.tar.gz \
  --embedding-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  --embedding-ctx-size 8192 \
  --system-prompt ""You are a tour guide in London, UK. Please answer the question from a London visitor accurately."" \
  --rag-prompt ""The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n""
```

> The `--snapshot` could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a private vector collection snapshot.

Depending on the quality and size of the vectors, you might also need to change the `qdrant-` options to 
customize the retrieval behavior.

* `qdrant-limit` sets the max number of relevant context to add to the prompt. If your knowledge base consists of large sections of text (i.e., each book chapter is a vector), you should probably make this 1 or 2 to limit the prompt length to a reasonable size.
* `qdrant-score-threshold` is the min match ""score"" the knowledge content must meet in order to be considered ""relevant"". This depends on the quality of the knowledge text and the embedding model. In general, this score should be over 0.5 to reduce irrelevant context in the prompt.

> The embedding model encodes and transforms text into vectors so that the can be stored, searched and retrieved. For different
context material, you might need a different embedding model to achieve the optimal performance. 
The [MTEB leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) is a good place to see the performance
benchmarks of embedding models. You can find many of them in the [gaianet organization on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/gaianet).
 
### Customize prompts

In `config.json`, you can also customize the prompts. 
Prompts are often tailored for the finetuned LLM or the knowledge
base to generate optimal responses from the node.

The `--system-prompt` option sets a system prompt. It provides the background and ""personality"" of the node.
Each API request can set its own system prompt.

The `--rag-prompt` is the prompt to be appended after the system prompt (or user query). 
It introduces the RAG context retrieved from the vector database, which follows it.

The `--rag-policy` option specifies where the `rag-prompt` and context should go. 
By default, its value is `system-message` and it puts the context in the system prompt. 
But you could also set it to `last-user-message`, which
puts the `rag-prompt` and context in front of the latest message from the user.

## Next steps

Remember to re-initialize and re-start the node after you make configuration changes.

```
# If the node is running
# gaianet stop

gaianet init
gaianet start
```

Next, you can

* [Create a knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md) from your proprietary knowledge or skills.
* [Finetune](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md) your own LLM.

Have fun!

","Summary:
This is a comprehensive guide on how to customize a GaiaNet node. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Pre-set configurations**

# Customize Your GaiaNet Node

A key goal of the GaiaNet project is to enable each individual to create and run his or her own
agent service node using finetuned LLMs and proprietary knowledge. In all likelihood, 
you are not going to run a node with the [default](quick-start.md) Phi-3 LLM and Paris guidebook knowledge base.
In this chapter, we will discuss ways to customize your node.

## Pre-set configurations

All the node configuration options, such as LLM settings, vector collection for the knowledge base, and prompts, 
are all in the `gaianet/config.json` file. You can edit this file directly to use your models and vector collections.
Or, you can select a different `config.json` when you initialize the node. Just pass in a URL to the `config.json` file 
in your `gaianet init` command.
We have several pre-set `config.json` files to choose from [in this repo](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs).
For example, the following command initialize a GaiaNet node with a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

> The URL to the `config.json` must point to the actual text file. (i.e., the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL for GitHub links) instead of the GitHub HTML page for that file.

## The config subcommand

After you have initialized the node, you can still make changes to its configuration by editing the `config.json` file
directly. But it is easier and safer to use the `gaianet` CLI to make changes.

> You MUST run `gaianet init` again after you make any changes to the node configuration.

The following command shows the `config.json` fields you can make changes to.

```
gaianet config list
```

Now, let's look at some examples.

### Select an LLM

There are over 10,000 finetuned open-source LLMs you can choose from on Huggingface. They each have different sizes (larger models are more capable but more expensive to run), unique capabilities (e.g., uncensored, to excel in math or reasoning, to support large context length etc), domain expertise (e.g., medicine, coding), and / or styles (e.g., to speak like a teacher or a pirate, to respond in code, to follow conversations).

To replace GaiaNet node's default LLM with an alternative
finetuned model, you will need to make changes to the model file, prompt template, and model context length parameters.
Those parameters vary depending on the model, but they can be found on the [GaiaNet Huggingface organization's](https://huggingface.co/gaianet) model cards. For example, the following command changes the LLM to a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet config \
  --chat-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --chat-ctx-size 4096 \
  --prompt-template llama-3-chat 
```

> The llama 3 8B model requires at least 16GB of RAM.

If none of the published finetuned models are perfect for your use case, you can also finetune your own LLM by following [these guides](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md). Your GaiaNet node can run your own finetuned models. 

> The `--chat-url` argument could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file.

  --embedding-ctx-size 8192 \
  --system-prompt ""You are a tour guide in London, UK. Please answer the question from a London visitor accurately."" \
  --rag-prompt ""The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n""
```

> The `--snapshot` could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a private vector collection snapshot.

Depending on the quality and size of the vectors, you might also need to change the `qdrant-` options to 
customize the retrieval behavior.

","Q: Is there a pre-set configuration option for using a finetuned LLM and proprietary knowledge base?
A: Yes, you can use the `gaianet init` command with a URL to a pre-set configuration file that specifies a finetuned LLM and proprietary knowledge base. For example:

```bash
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct-with-private-knowledge/config.json
```

This command initializes the node with the `llama-3-8b-instruct-with-private-knowledge` configuration, which includes a finetuned LLM and proprietary knowledge base.

Note that you can replace the URL to point to any pre-set configuration file in the [GaiaNet repository](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs).

Also, you can customize the pre-set configurations by editing the `config.json` file directly or using the `gaianet config` command to make changes.

Here's an example of a pre-set configuration for a finetuned LLM and proprietary knowledge base:
```json
{
  ""model"": {
    ""chat_url"": ""https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf"",

  },
  ...
}
```
This configuration includes a finetuned LLM and proprietary knowledge base, with the `llama-3-chat` prompt template and the `private-knowledge-base` snapshot URL.

```

Now, let's look at some examples.

### Select an LLM

There are over 10,000 finetuned open-source LLMs you can choose from on Huggingface. They each have different sizes (larger models are more capable but more expensive to run), unique capabilities (e.g., uncensored, to excel in math or reasoning, to support large context length etc), domain expertise (e.g., medicine, coding), and / or styles (e.g., to speak like a teacher or a pirate, to respond in code, to follow conversations).

If none of the published finetuned models are perfect for your use case, you can also finetune your own LLM by following [these guides](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md). Your GaiaNet node can run your own finetuned models. 

> The `--chat-url` argument could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file.

### Select a knowledge base

A key feature of GaiaNet is that users can create and deploy proprietary knowledge base on the node to supplement
the LLM. Each knowledge base is a snapshot file for a vector collection. 
We encourage you to [create your own knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md). But you can also use

* use the same embedding model that generated this vector collection.
* modify the `system_prompt` to give the model background knowledge.
* modify the `rag_prompt` to instruct the model to answer the question when context is retrieved from the vector collection.

The following example changes the knowledge base in the node from ""Paris guidebook"" to ""London guidebook"". 

```
gaianet config \

The `--rag-prompt` is the prompt to be appended after the system prompt (or user query). 
It introduces the RAG context retrieved from the vector database, which follows it.

The `--rag-policy` option specifies where the `rag-prompt` and context should go. 
By default, its value is `system-message` and it puts the context in the system prompt. 
But you could also set it to `last-user-message`, which
puts the `rag-prompt` and context in front of the latest message from the user.

## Next steps

Remember to re-initialize and re-start the node after you make configuration changes.

```
# If the node is running
# gaianet stop

gaianet init
gaianet start
```

Next, you can

* [Create a knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md) from your proprietary knowledge or skills.
* [Finetune](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md) your own LLM.

Have fun!

","Q: How do you specify an LLM in a configuration file?
A: To specify an LLM in a configuration file, you will need to make changes to the `model` file and `prompt_template` parameters. The parameters vary depending on the model, but they can be found on the [GaiaNet Huggingface organization's](https://huggingface.co/gaianet) model cards.

Here is an example of how to specify an LLM in a configuration file:

```bash
gaianet config \
  --model https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --prompt-template llama-3-chat 
```

In this example, the `--model` option specifies the LLM file and its parameters. The `--prompt-template` option sets a prompt template that is tailored to the specified model.

Alternatively, you can also use a local file instead of a public URL:

```bash
gaianet config \
  --model /path/to/local/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF.gguf \
  --prompt-template llama-3-chat 
```

This allows you to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file."

# Customize Your GaiaNet Node

A key goal of the GaiaNet project is to enable each individual to create and run his or her own
agent service node using finetuned LLMs and proprietary knowledge. In all likelihood, 
you are not going to run a node with the [default](quick-start.md) Phi-3 LLM and Paris guidebook knowledge base.
In this chapter, we will discuss ways to customize your node.

## Pre-set configurations

All the node configuration options, such as LLM settings, vector collection for the knowledge base, and prompts, 
are all in the `gaianet/config.json` file. You can edit this file directly to use your models and vector collections.
Or, you can select a different `config.json` when you initialize the node. Just pass in a URL to the `config.json` file 
in your `gaianet init` command.
We have several pre-set `config.json` files to choose from [in this repo](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs).
For example, the following command initialize a GaiaNet node with a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

> The URL to the `config.json` must point to the actual text file. (i.e., the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL for GitHub links) instead of the GitHub HTML page for that file.

## The config subcommand

After you have initialized the node, you can still make changes to its configuration by editing the `config.json` file
directly. But it is easier and safer to use the `gaianet` CLI to make changes.

> You MUST run `gaianet init` again after you make any changes to the node configuration.

The following command shows the `config.json` fields you can make changes to.

```
gaianet config list
```

Now, let's look at some examples.

### Select an LLM

There are over 10,000 finetuned open-source LLMs you can choose from on Huggingface. They each have different sizes (larger models are more capable but more expensive to run), unique capabilities (e.g., uncensored, to excel in math or reasoning, to support large context length etc), domain expertise (e.g., medicine, coding), and / or styles (e.g., to speak like a teacher or a pirate, to respond in code, to follow conversations).

To replace GaiaNet node's default LLM with an alternative
finetuned model, you will need to make changes to the model file, prompt template, and model context length parameters.
Those parameters vary depending on the model, but they can be found on the [GaiaNet Huggingface organization's](https://huggingface.co/gaianet) model cards. For example, the following command changes the LLM to a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet config \
  --chat-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --chat-ctx-size 4096 \
  --prompt-template llama-3-chat 
```

> The llama 3 8B model requires at least 16GB of RAM.

If none of the published finetuned models are perfect for your use case, you can also finetune your own LLM by following [these guides](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md). Your GaiaNet node can run your own finetuned models. 

> The `--chat-url` argument could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file.

### Select a knowledge base

A key feature of GaiaNet is that users can create and deploy proprietary knowledge base on the node to supplement
the LLM. Each knowledge base is a snapshot file for a vector collection. 
We encourage you to [create your own knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md). But you can also use 
ready-made knowledge bases. You will need to do the following.

* specify the URL to the vector collection (i.e., the `snapshot` or `snapshot.tar.gz` file) in the `snapshot` option.
* use the same embedding model that generated this vector collection.
* modify the `system_prompt` to give the model background knowledge.
* modify the `rag_prompt` to instruct the model to answer the question when context is retrieved from the vector collection.

The following example changes the knowledge base in the node from ""Paris guidebook"" to ""London guidebook"". 

```
gaianet config \
  --snapshot https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/london/resolve/main/london_768_nomic-embed-text-v1.5-f16.snapshot.tar.gz \
  --embedding-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  --embedding-ctx-size 8192 \
  --system-prompt ""You are a tour guide in London, UK. Please answer the question from a London visitor accurately."" \
  --rag-prompt ""The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n""
```

> The `--snapshot` could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a private vector collection snapshot.

Depending on the quality and size of the vectors, you might also need to change the `qdrant-` options to 
customize the retrieval behavior.

* `qdrant-limit` sets the max number of relevant context to add to the prompt. If your knowledge base consists of large sections of text (i.e., each book chapter is a vector), you should probably make this 1 or 2 to limit the prompt length to a reasonable size.
* `qdrant-score-threshold` is the min match ""score"" the knowledge content must meet in order to be considered ""relevant"". This depends on the quality of the knowledge text and the embedding model. In general, this score should be over 0.5 to reduce irrelevant context in the prompt.

> The embedding model encodes and transforms text into vectors so that the can be stored, searched and retrieved. For different
context material, you might need a different embedding model to achieve the optimal performance. 
The [MTEB leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) is a good place to see the performance
benchmarks of embedding models. You can find many of them in the [gaianet organization on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/gaianet).
 
### Customize prompts

In `config.json`, you can also customize the prompts. 
Prompts are often tailored for the finetuned LLM or the knowledge
base to generate optimal responses from the node.

The `--system-prompt` option sets a system prompt. It provides the background and ""personality"" of the node.
Each API request can set its own system prompt.

The `--rag-prompt` is the prompt to be appended after the system prompt (or user query). 
It introduces the RAG context retrieved from the vector database, which follows it.

The `--rag-policy` option specifies where the `rag-prompt` and context should go. 
By default, its value is `system-message` and it puts the context in the system prompt. 
But you could also set it to `last-user-message`, which
puts the `rag-prompt` and context in front of the latest message from the user.

## Next steps

Remember to re-initialize and re-start the node after you make configuration changes.

```
# If the node is running
# gaianet stop

gaianet init
gaianet start
```

Next, you can

* [Create a knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md) from your proprietary knowledge or skills.
* [Finetune](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md) your own LLM.

Have fun!

","Q: Do all models have the same model context length parameters?
A: No, not all models have the same model context length parameters. The parameters vary depending on the specific model and its architecture.

In general, larger models can process longer contexts, but they often require more computational resources and memory to do so. Smaller models might have a shorter maximum context length or might not support long context at all.

For example:

* Some LLMs like BERT or RoBERTa typically use a fixed sequence length of 512-514 tokens (about 2000 characters) as the input size.
* Larger transformer-based models, such as XLNet, Longformer, and BigBird, might have longer maximum context lengths, up to thousands of tokens.
* Some special-purpose models, like chatbots or summarization models, might have very short context lengths, often limited by the size of a single response.

To determine the correct model context length parameters for your specific use case, you should consult the documentation and guidelines provided with the model you're using. This can usually be found on the model's official website or in its accompanying documentation.

In the context of GaiaNet, the `--chat-ctx-size` parameter is used to specify the maximum input sequence length for the LLM. The default value might need to be adjusted depending on the specific LLM being used and its characteristics.

For example, if you're using a Llama 3 8B model, which requires at least 16GB of RAM, you should set `--chat-ctx-size` to at least 4096, as mentioned in the text:

```
gaianet config \
  --chat-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --chat-ctx-size 4096 \
  --prompt-template llama-3-chat 
```

Keep in mind that exceeding the maximum allowed context length can result in errors, warnings, or suboptimal performance from your model. Be sure to check and adjust these parameters as needed for each specific use case and model combination."

","Q: What is the purpose of the vector collection in the knowledge base?
A: In the GaiaNet knowledge base, a vector collection is used to store and retrieve relevant information or context for answering user questions.

A vector collection typically consists of:

1. **Text**: A large corpus of text that serves as the source material for training an embedding model.
2. **Vectors**: The output of the embedding model, which represents each piece of text as a dense vector in a high-dimensional space (e.g., 128-dimensional or 768-dimensional).

When you create a knowledge base, you can use this vector collection to:

1. **Index** relevant pieces of information: Each piece of text is indexed by its corresponding vector.
2. **Retrieval**: When the node receives a user question, it can search through the vector collection to find the most relevant pieces of context that match the query.

The vector collection plays a crucial role in enabling the node to retrieve and provide accurate answers to questions based on your proprietary knowledge or expertise.

In practice, you might use a pre-existing vector collection or create a new one by:

1. **Training an embedding model** on your text data.
2. **Indexing** the trained vectors in Qdrant, an efficient indexing algorithm for large-scale vector databases.

The vector collection serves as a bridge between your knowledge base and the node's ability to provide answers to user questions.

Example use cases:

* Creating a medical knowledge base with relevant articles or guidelines.
* Building a language translation system that uses parallel text data.
* Developing a chatbot that requires domain-specific knowledge in fields like finance, law, or technology.

By utilizing vector collections effectively, you can unlock the full potential of GaiaNet and create sophisticated, human-like conversational agents.

**Bonus tip:** When working with large-scale text corpora, consider using pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) to fine-tune your own embedding model for better results."

After you have initialized the node, you can still make changes to its configuration by editing the `config.json` file
directly. But it is easier and safer to use the `gaianet` CLI to make changes.

> You MUST run `gaianet init` again after you make any changes to the node configuration.

The following command shows the `config.json` fields you can make changes to.

```
gaianet config list
```

Now, let's look at some examples.

### Select an LLM

There are over 10,000 finetuned open-source LLMs you can choose from on Huggingface. They each have different sizes (larger models are more capable but more expensive to run), unique capabilities (e.g., uncensored, to excel in math or reasoning, to support large context length etc), domain expertise (e.g., medicine, coding), and / or styles (e.g., to speak like a teacher or a pirate, to respond in code, to follow conversations).

To replace GaiaNet node's default LLM with an alternative
finetuned model, you will need to make changes to the model file, prompt template, and model context length parameters.
Those parameters vary depending on the model, but they can be found on the [GaiaNet Huggingface organization's](https://huggingface.co/gaianet) model cards. For example, the following command changes the LLM to a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet config \
  --chat-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --chat-ctx-size 4096 \
  --prompt-template llama-3-chat 
```

> The llama 3 8B model requires at least 16GB of RAM.

If none of the published finetuned models are perfect for your use case, you can also finetune your own LLM by following [these guides](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md). Your GaiaNet node can run your own finetuned models. 

> The `--chat-url` argument could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file.

### Select a knowledge base

A key feature of GaiaNet is that users can create and deploy proprietary knowledge base on the node to supplement
the LLM. Each knowledge base is a snapshot file for a vector collection. 
We encourage you to [create your own knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md). But you can also use 
ready-made knowledge bases. You will need to do the following.

* specify the URL to the vector collection (i.e., the `snapshot` or `snapshot.tar.gz` file) in the `snapshot` option.
* use the same embedding model that generated this vector collection.
* modify the `system_prompt` to give the model background knowledge.
* modify the `rag_prompt` to instruct the model to answer the question when context is retrieved from the vector collection.

The following example changes the knowledge base in the node from ""Paris guidebook"" to ""London guidebook"". 

```
gaianet config \
  --snapshot https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/london/resolve/main/london_768_nomic-embed-text-v1.5-f16.snapshot.tar.gz \
  --embedding-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  --embedding-ctx-size 8192 \
  --system-prompt ""You are a tour guide in London, UK. Please answer the question from a London visitor accurately."" \
  --rag-prompt ""The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n""
```

> The `--snapshot` could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL. That allows you to use a private vector collection snapshot.

Depending on the quality and size of the vectors, you might also need to change the `qdrant-` options to 
customize the retrieval behavior.

* `qdrant-limit` sets the max number of relevant context to add to the prompt. If your knowledge base consists of large sections of text (i.e., each book chapter is a vector), you should probably make this 1 or 2 to limit the prompt length to a reasonable size.
* `qdrant-score-threshold` is the min match ""score"" the knowledge content must meet in order to be considered ""relevant"". This depends on the quality of the knowledge text and the embedding model. In general, this score should be over 0.5 to reduce irrelevant context in the prompt.

> The embedding model encodes and transforms text into vectors so that the can be stored, searched and retrieved. For different
context material, you might need a different embedding model to achieve the optimal performance. 
The [MTEB leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) is a good place to see the performance
benchmarks of embedding models. You can find many of them in the [gaianet organization on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/gaianet).
 
### Customize prompts

In `config.json`, you can also customize the prompts. 
Prompts are often tailored for the finetuned LLM or the knowledge
base to generate optimal responses from the node.

The `--system-prompt` option sets a system prompt. It provides the background and ""personality"" of the node.
Each API request can set its own system prompt.

The `--rag-prompt` is the prompt to be appended after the system prompt (or user query). 
It introduces the RAG context retrieved from the vector database, which follows it.

The `--rag-policy` option specifies where the `rag-prompt` and context should go. 
By default, its value is `system-message` and it puts the context in the system prompt. 
But you could also set it to `last-user-message`, which
puts the `rag-prompt` and context in front of the latest message from the user.

## Next steps

Remember to re-initialize and re-start the node after you make configuration changes.

```
# If the node is running
# gaianet stop

gaianet init
gaianet start
```

Next, you can

* [Create a knowledge base](../creator-guide/knowledge/concepts.md) from your proprietary knowledge or skills.
* [Finetune](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md) your own LLM.

Have fun!

","Q: Is it possible to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file?
A: Yes, it is possible to use a privately trained or finetuned LLM model file with the GaiaNet node. 

The `--chat-url` argument could point to a local file under `$HOME/gaianet` instead of a public URL, allowing you to use your own privately trained or finetuned LLM model file.

Here is an example:

```
gaianet config \
  --chat-url /path/to/your/local/model/file.gguf

# Customize Your GaiaNet Node

A key goal of the GaiaNet project is to enable each individual to create and run his or her own
agent service node using finetuned LLMs and proprietary knowledge. In all likelihood, 
you are not going to run a node with the [default](quick-start.md) Phi-3 LLM and Paris guidebook knowledge base.
In this chapter, we will discuss ways to customize your node.

## Pre-set configurations

All the node configuration options, such as LLM settings, vector collection for the knowledge base, and prompts, 
are all in the `gaianet/config.json` file. You can edit this file directly to use your models and vector collections.
Or, you can select a different `config.json` when you initialize the node. Just pass in a URL to the `config.json` file 
in your `gaianet init` command.
We have several pre-set `config.json` files to choose from [in this repo](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs).
For example, the following command initialize a GaiaNet node with a Llama 3 8B model.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

> The URL to the `config.json` must point to the actual text file. (i.e., the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL for GitHub links) instead of the GitHub HTML page for that file.

","Q: Can a user create and deploy their own proprietary knowledge base on the node?
A: Yes, a key feature of GaiaNet is that users can create and deploy proprietary knowledge base on the node to supplement the LLM. Each knowledge base is a snapshot file for a vector collection.

To do this, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Create your own knowledge base**: This involves collecting relevant information from various sources and formatting it into vectors using an embedding model. You can use pre-existing tools or write your own scripts to create the vector collection.
2. **Snapshot your knowledge base**: Once you have created your vector collection, you will need to take a snapshot of it. This is essentially a copy of the entire dataset that can be stored and referenced later.

To deploy your proprietary knowledge base on the node, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the `config.json` file**: Modify the `snapshot` option in the `config.json` file to point to your own vector collection snapshot.
2. **Use the same embedding model**: Make sure you use the same embedding model that generated this vector collection.
3. **Customize system prompts and RAG prompts**: Add or modify the system prompts and rag prompts as necessary to provide background knowledge for your proprietary knowledge base.

**Example command to deploy a proprietary knowledge base**

```bash
gaianet config \
  --snapshot https://path/to/your/kb/snapshot.tar.gz \
  --embedding-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  --embedding-ctx-size 8192 \
  --system-prompt ""This is a system prompt specific to your knowledge base"" \
  --rag-prompt ""The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n""
```

By following these steps, you can create and deploy your own proprietary knowledge base on the node.

**Bonus Tip**: If none of the published finetuned models are perfect for your use case, you can also **finetune your own LLM** by following [these guides](../creator-guide/finetune/intro.md). Your GaiaNet node can run your own finetuned models."

","Q: How do you customize prompts in the `config.json` file?
A: You can customize prompts in the `config.json` file by using the following options:

*   `--system-prompt`: This option sets a system prompt that provides the background and personality of the node. Each API request can set its own system prompt.
*   `--rag-prompt`: This is the prompt to be appended after the system prompt (or user query). It introduces the RAG context retrieved from the vector database, which follows it.

Here are some examples:

### Customize the System Prompt

To change the system prompt in the node, you can use the following command:

```bash
gaianet config \
  --system-prompt ""You are a tour guide in London, UK. Please answer the question from a London visitor accurately.""
```

In this example, the system prompt is set to provide background and personality for the node.

### Customize the RAG Prompt

To change the RAG prompt in the node, you can use the following command:

```bash
gaianet config \
  --rag-prompt ""The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n""
```

In this example, the RAG prompt is set to introduce the context retrieved from the vector database.

### Customize both System and RAG Prompts

You can also customize both system and RAG prompts together. Here's an example:

```bash
gaianet config \
  --system-prompt ""You are a tour guide in London, UK. Please answer the question from a London visitor accurately."" \
  --rag-prompt ""The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n""
```

In this example, both system and RAG prompts are customized to provide background and personality for the node and introduce the context retrieved from the vector database.

By customizing these prompts in the `config.json` file, you can fine-tune the behavior of your GaiaNet node to suit specific use cases or applications."

","Q: Is there any difference between installing the latest and a specific version of GaiaNet Node?
A: Yes, there are differences between installing the latest and a specific version of GaiaNet Node.

**Installing the latest version:**

When you install the latest version of GaiaNet Node using the command:

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
```

You will get the most recent release from the `master` branch or the latest tagged release, whichever is newer. This ensures you have the newest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements available.

**Installing a specific version:**

When you install a specific version of GaiaNet Node using the command:

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/download/0.1.3/install.sh' | bash
```

You will get a particular release version, in this case `v0.1.3`, which might have known issues or features that are no longer supported by the newer releases.

Here are some key differences:

* **Features and bug fixes:** The latest version of GaiaNet Node will have all the new features and bug fixes since the specific version you're installing.
* **Security:** Newer versions often include security patches, so installing the latest version ensures you have the most secure version available.
* **Performance:** Newer releases might include performance improvements or optimizations that are not present in older versions.

**When to install a specific version:**

There might be situations where you need to install an older version of GaiaNet Node, such as:

* To reproduce a bug that was fixed in an earlier release
* To ensure compatibility with other dependencies or systems that don't support newer releases
* For specific testing or development purposes

However, if possible, it's always recommended to use the latest version of GaiaNet Node for production environments."

","Q: How can you change the directory where Gaianet will be installed? 
A: You can change the directory where Gaianet will be installed by using the `--base` option when running the installation command.

Here's an example of how to install Gaianet in a custom directory:

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s --  --base <Full_Path>
```

Replace `<Full_Path>` with the actual path where you want to install Gaianet.

For example, if you want to install Gaianet in a directory named `gaianet-test` located in your home directory, you can use:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/gaianet-test
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s --  --base $HOME/gaianet-test
```

Once you've installed Gaianet in a custom directory, make sure to specify the same directory when running `gaianet init`, `gaianet start`, and other commands. You can do this by adding the `--base` option with the path of your custom directory.

**Important:** If you want to use the same node after reinstalling Gaianet in a different location, make sure to keep the `nodeid.json` file and `frpc.toml` file from the original installation safe."

#### Change the port number
By default, the GaiaNet starts on port 50051. To change to another port number, you can modify the `port` field in the `$HOME/gaianet/config.json` file.

```
{
    ""port"": 8080
}
```

In this example, the node will start on port 8080 instead of 50051.

#### Other configuration options
You can also customize your GaiaNet by modifying other fields in the `config.json` file. For more information about available configuration options, see [system-requirements](system-requirements).

### Bonus tip

*   You can use environment variables to override configuration values. For example, you can set an environment variable `GAIA_NET_MODEL=huggingface/parlai` and it will be used instead of the value specified in `config.json`.
*   Make sure to restart your node after changing the configuration for the changes to take effect.

Example:

```
export GAIA_NET_MODEL=huggingface/parlai
gaianet init
```"

# Join the GaiaNet Protocol

After successfully running a GaiaNet node on your machine, it's time to join the GaiaNet protocol network and get rewards for sharing computing power with the world by binding your node ID and device ID to a Metamask account.

When you run a node with the Getting Started guide, you may notice that the GaiaNet software has generated a node ID for you. The node ID is an ETH address. The easiest way to find the node ID is to use `gaianet info` to print the node ID and device ID on the terminal.

```
gaianet info
```
The output will be the following:

```
Node ID: 0x80642b1----9a76a284efeb2bb6d142e

Device ID: device-e77---1446f1b51
```
![](register-01.png)

To receive your rewards, all you need to do is bind your node ID and device id with a Metamask account via the GaiaNet web portal.

* Open https://www.gaianet.ai/ on your browser and log in to the website with your Metamask account
* Select the **Setting** section by clicking on your account, then click on the nodes and ** Connect New Node** button.
* Next copy and paste your node ID into the relevant field and do the same for the device ID in the second box. Then, click on the Join button.
  
![](register-02.png)

* After your node is joined successfully, it will be displayed in the list of nodes on the Node Page.

![](register-03.png)

* You can bind multiple node IDs and its corresponding device IDs to your MetaMask wallet address if you are running multiple nodes.


> Please noted, don't share the device ID with others.

### Protect your node ID and device ID

The GaiaNet installer generates a pair of ETH address and keystore and password for your node automatically. This information is stored in the `gaianet/nodeid.json` file. Please keep the JSON file carefully.

* The ETH address is your node ID. You will use this ETH address to join the GaiaNet network.
* The keystore stores the private key associated with the ETH address encrypted by the password.

The `nodeid.json` is the only proof that your node belongs to you. 
In many protocol operations, you will need this private key to sign request messages to send to the protocol smart contracts.

The device id is only visible to yourself.

### Select a different domain

By default, a new GaiaNet node joins the `gaianet.network` domain. You can select a different domain to join by putting
the GaiaNet domain's public DNS name in the `domain` field in the `config.json`. Please note that most GaiaNet domains
require approval for nodes to join. You have to abide by the domain's rules before your node becomes publically accessible
on the domain URL.

","Summary:
This is a guide on how to join the GaiaNet protocol network and receive rewards for sharing computing power.

**Step 1: Obtain Node ID and Device ID**

After setting up a GaiaNet node, run `gaianet info` in the terminal to print the node ID and device ID. The output will show an ETH address (node ID) and a unique identifier (device ID).

**Step 2: Register on GaiaNet Web Portal**

1. Open the GaiaNet web portal at https://www.gaianet.ai/ and log in with your Metamask account.
2. Click on your account to access the settings, then select ""Nodes"" and click on ""Connect New Node"".
3. Copy and paste the node ID into the relevant field and the device ID into the second box. Then click on ""Join"".

**Step 3: Verify Node Connection**

After successful connection, the node will be listed on the Node Page.

**Tips and Reminders**

* You can bind multiple node IDs and their corresponding device IDs to your MetaMask wallet address.
* Do not share your device ID with others.
* Keep the `nodeid.json` file carefully as it contains private keys associated with ETH addresses, which are used for protocol operations.

**Optional: Select a Different Domain**

By default, nodes join the `gaianet.network` domain. To select a different domain, modify the `domain` field in `config.json`. Note that some domains may have specific requirements or approval processes before allowing nodes to join."

","Q: What is the protocol network being joined by GaiaNet nodes?
A: GaiaNet nodes are being joined to the GaiaNet protocol network. The GaiaNet protocol is a decentralized network that leverages blockchain technology and peer-to-peer connections to enable a global, open-source network of computing resources. When you join the GaiaNet protocol network by binding your node ID and device ID to a Metamask account via the GaiaNet web portal, you become part of this community-driven project.

The GaiaNet protocol is designed to facilitate sharing and monetization of computing resources across the globe, making it a decentralized cloud infrastructure. By joining the network, users can share their computational power with others, while also contributing to the development and maintenance of the network. In return, participating nodes can earn rewards in the form of tokens or other incentives.

To ensure the security and integrity of the network, GaiaNet relies on its robust protocol architecture, which includes features such as:

1. **Decentralized governance**: The GaiaNet protocol is community-driven, allowing participants to contribute to decision-making processes through voting mechanisms.
2. **Consensus mechanism**: Nodes in the network use a consensus algorithm (e.g., proof-of-stake or Byzantine Fault Tolerance) to ensure that all transactions and data are validated accurately and consistently across the network.
3. **Secure data storage**: GaiaNet employs advanced cryptography techniques, such as encryption and digital signatures, to safeguard user data and prevent unauthorized access.

By joining the GaiaNet protocol network, individuals can become part of a global community working towards creating a decentralized, open-source cloud infrastructure that promotes fairness, security, and transparency in computing resource sharing.

**Bonus Tip:** To ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the GaiaNet network, users are encouraged to participate in its governance through voting on proposals and participating in discussions on the GaiaNet forums. By actively contributing to the network's decision-making processes, individuals can help shape the future direction of the project and maximize their returns from participating in the network."

# Join the GaiaNet Protocol

After successfully running a GaiaNet node on your machine, it's time to join the GaiaNet protocol network and get rewards for sharing computing power with the world by binding your node ID and device ID to a Metamask account.

When you run a node with the Getting Started guide, you may notice that the GaiaNet software has generated a node ID for you. The node ID is an ETH address. The easiest way to find the node ID is to use `gaianet info` to print the node ID and device ID on the terminal.

```
gaianet info
```
The output will be the following:

```
Node ID: 0x80642b1----9a76a284efeb2bb6d142e

Device ID: device-e77---1446f1b51
```
![](register-01.png)

To receive your rewards, all you need to do is bind your node ID and device id with a Metamask account via the GaiaNet web portal.

* Open https://www.gaianet.ai/ on your browser and log in to the website with your Metamask account
* Select the **Setting** section by clicking on your account, then click on the nodes and ** Connect New Node** button.
* Next copy and paste your node ID into the relevant field and do the same for the device ID in the second box. Then, click on the Join button.
  
![](register-02.png)

* After your node is joined successfully, it will be displayed in the list of nodes on the Node Page.

![](register-03.png)

* You can bind multiple node IDs and its corresponding device IDs to your MetaMask wallet address if you are running multiple nodes.


> Please noted, don't share the device ID with others.

### Protect your node ID and device ID

The GaiaNet installer generates a pair of ETH address and keystore and password for your node automatically. This information is stored in the `gaianet/nodeid.json` file. Please keep the JSON file carefully.

* The ETH address is your node ID. You will use this ETH address to join the GaiaNet network.
* The keystore stores the private key associated with the ETH address encrypted by the password.

The `nodeid.json` is the only proof that your node belongs to you. 
In many protocol operations, you will need this private key to sign request messages to send to the protocol smart contracts.

The device id is only visible to yourself.

### Select a different domain

By default, a new GaiaNet node joins the `gaianet.network` domain. You can select a different domain to join by putting
the GaiaNet domain's public DNS name in the `domain` field in the `config.json`. Please note that most GaiaNet domains
require approval for nodes to join. You have to abide by the domain's rules before your node becomes publically accessible
on the domain URL.

","Q: How does one find their node ID?
A: To find your node ID, you can use the `gaianet info` command in the terminal. This will print both the node ID and device ID.

```
gaianet info
```

The output should look something like this:

```
Node ID: 0x80642b1----9a76a284efeb2bb6d142e

Device ID: device-e77---1446f1b51
```

Alternatively, you can also find your node ID by checking the `gaianet/nodeid.json` file. This file is created automatically when you run a GaiaNet node and contains the following information:

* `node_id`: The ETH address of your node.
* `keystore`: The encrypted private key associated with the ETH address.

You can open this file in a text editor to view your node ID.

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to keep both the `gaianet/nodeid.json` file and the terminal output secure, as they contain sensitive information."

2. **Keystore**: The keystore contains the private key associated with the Node ID, encrypted by a password.

In other words, the `nodeid.json` file holds the proof of ownership for your GaiaNet node, making it essential for various protocol operations that require authentication.

The contents of the `nodeid.json` file can be represented as follows:
```json
{
  ""ethAddress"": ""<NODE_ID_ETH_ADDRESS>"",
  ""keystore"": {
    ""address"": ""<NODE_ID_ETH_ADDRESS>"",
    ""cipherText"": ""<ENCRYPTED_PRIVATE_KEY>"",

        ""p"": 50000
      },
      ""salt"": ""<SALT>""
    },
    ""version"": 3
  }
}
```
Note that the actual content of the file may vary depending on the specific GaiaNet configuration and implementation.

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to keep the `nodeid.json` file secure, as it contains sensitive information (the private key). Store it in a safe location, such as an encrypted storage device or a password manager."

require approval for nodes to join. You have to abide by the domain's rules before your node becomes publically accessible
on the domain URL.

","Q: Why should you not share your device ID with others?
A: You should not share your device ID with others because it can be used to identify and track your node on the GaiaNet network. Here are a few reasons why sharing your device ID is discouraged:

1. **Security risk**: If your device ID falls into the wrong hands, they could potentially use it to identify your node and exploit any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in your node's configuration.
2. **Tracking and surveillance**: By sharing your device ID, you may inadvertently make it easier for third parties to track your node's activities on the network, which can be a concern for users who value their online anonymity.
3. **Misuse of resources**: In some cases, malicious actors might use your device ID to launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or other types of abuse against the GaiaNet network.

To maintain control over your node and its activities on the network, it's essential to keep your device ID confidential and only share it with trusted parties who need access to your node for legitimate purposes.

**Bonus tip:** To further protect your node, consider using a strong password for your Metamask wallet and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This will add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to your account and node.

**Example outside the content:** Imagine you're participating in a cryptocurrency mining pool, and you've shared your device ID with other pool members to facilitate coordination and resource sharing. However, one of the members uses this information to compromise the security of another pool member's node, leading to a loss of funds or sensitive data. This scenario highlights the importance of keeping sensitive information like device IDs confidential to avoid potential risks and consequences."

","Q: What regions are the GaiaNet_ubuntu22.04_amd64_cuda12 AMI image available in?
A: The GaiaNet_ubuntu22.04_amd64_cuda12 AMI image is available in the following regions:

1. N. Virginia
2. Ohio
3. N. California
4. Oregon
5. Osaka (Asia Pacific)

These are the regions where you can launch an instance using this AMI image, according to the provided table.

**Bonus Tip:** When launching an instance with a specific AMI image, make sure that the region you choose is compatible with the image's availability. In this case, the GaiaNet_ubuntu22.04_amd64_cuda12 AMI image is available in all the specified regions. If you try to launch it in another region where it's not available, the instance launch will fail.

**Example outside of the content:** Imagine you're launching a new project and want to use this GaiaNet_ubuntu22.04_amd64_cuda12 AMI image for your instances. You've chosen the Osaka (Asia Pacific) region because your team members are mostly located in Asia, and it's closer to their geographical location. However, you've forgotten that some of your dependencies or integrations require a specific AWS service that's only available in N. Virginia or another region. In this case, you might need to choose a different AMI image that's compatible with the services you're using or refactor your setup to work within the limitations of the Osaka (Asia Pacific) region."

","Q: Where can we go to interact with the GaiaNet node once it's started?
A: Once your GaiaNet node is started, you can interact with it by visiting the URL that was displayed on the console after running the `gaianet start` command. This URL should look something like this:

`https://<node-id>.gaiadns.com`

Replace `<node-id>` with the actual ID of your GaiaNet node.

By visiting this URL, you can access the GaiaNet interface and interact with your node through various means such as:

1. **Text-based interface**: You can type commands to query the knowledge base, execute tasks, or access features.
2. **Web UI**: Some nodes may provide a web-based user interface for interacting with the node's features, such as task execution, model management, and configuration settings.

Please note that you may need to authenticate yourself using a username and password (or API key) before accessing the GaiaNet interface.

**Bonus tip:** Make sure to keep your node's public IP address and port number secure, as they are accessible from outside your network. You can also set up access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive features or data.

**Example external use case:** Imagine you've started a GaiaNet node on AWS using an AMI image and want to integrate it with your company's internal workflow management system. After accessing the GaiaNet interface, you can create custom APIs or webhooks to exchange data between your systems, enabling seamless communication and automation of tasks."

You can [customize your GaiaNet node](../customize.md) with your own choice of LLMs and knowledge base snapshots.

## Running a CPU-only AWS instance

Load the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and sign into your account. Go to EC2 | instances and 
click on the ""Launch instance"" button.

In the ""Application and OS Images"" section, search the AMI catalog and select the image named 

* `GaiaNet_ubuntu22.04_amd64` for x86 CPU machines
* `GaiaNet_ubuntu22.04_arm64` for ARM CPU machines

In the ""Instance type"" section, select an instance with at least 8GB of RAM. For example, we recommend `t2.large` or `t2.xlarge` instances.

In the ""Network settings"", make sure that you allow SSH connections.

Click on the ""Launch instance"" button and wait for instance to start up. Once the instance is ready, SSH
into its public IP address. Once you are in the VM, run the following two commands.

```
gaianet init
gaianet start
```

The node is ready when it shows `The GaiaNet node is started at: https://...` on the console.
You can go to that URL from your browser to interact with the GaiaNet node.

You can [customize your GaiaNet node](../customize.md) with your own choice of LLMs and knowledge base snapshots.

Good luck!

","Q: What are the commands that should be run on the VM after SSHing into its public IP address?
A: According to the text, after SSHing into the VM's public IP address, you should run the following two commands:

```
gaianet init
gaianet start
```

These commands will initialize and start the GaiaNet node.

**Bonus Tip:** Before running these commands, make sure that you're in the correct directory within the VM. You can check this by running `pwd` (print working directory) command to see where your current working directory is set to. If it's not the root directory (`/`), navigate to the root directory using `cd /` command before running the above commands.

**Additional Example:** Suppose you want to customize your GaiaNet node with your own choice of LLMs and knowledge base snapshots, as mentioned in the text. In that case, after running the `gaianet init` command, you can navigate to the `config` directory within the VM using `cd config` command. Then, you can edit the configuration files (e.g., `llm.json`) to customize your GaiaNet node settings as needed."

","Q: Is CUDA 12.2 or newer required to be installed on the system?
A: According to the provided guide, CUDA 12.2 is specifically required and mentioned in several places. For example, when downloading the CUDA installer, the version `cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run` is specified. Additionally, when running the installer, it is explicitly installed with the `--toolkitpath=/usr/local/cuda-12` option to create a new directory for CUDA 12.

Therefore, yes, CUDA 12.2 or newer (in this case, specifically version 12.2) is required and has been installed on the system as per the provided instructions.

**Bonus Tip:** If you need to install an older or newer version of CUDA, make sure to update the corresponding versions in all occurrences throughout the guide to avoid any compatibility issues.

Example: If you want to install CUDA 11.8 instead of 12.2, change `cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run` to `cuda_11.8.0_470.63.01_linux.run`, and also update the directory paths accordingly (e.g., `/usr/local/cuda-11`)."

","Q: Which command updates the GRUB configuration?
A: The command that updates the GRUB configuration is:

```
sudo update-grub
```

This command rebuilds the grub configuration and refreshes the available boot entries. This is typically done after installing or modifying packages, such as when installing a new kernel.

Here's an explanation of why this step was necessary in the provided context:

After rebuilding the GRUB configuration with `update-grub`, the system can use the newly installed Nvidia driver. The previous lines in the script modify the GRUB configuration to include the correct kernel parameters for the Nvidia driver, and then updating the grub configuration allows the system to see these changes.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're experiencing issues with the GRUB configuration or want to troubleshoot problems, try running `update-grub` with the `-v` option to enable verbose output:

```
sudo update-grub -v
```"

","Q: Is a reboot required after disabling GSP and installing the Nvidia driver?
A: According to the script, a reboot is indeed recommended after disabling GSP. The line `sudo reboot` appears in the code snippet.

This is because the changes made to the kernel module configuration and the Nvidia driver settings take effect only after a system restart. By restarting the system, you ensure that these changes are applied correctly and the Nvidia driver is loaded with the new configuration.

However, it's worth noting that you can also try reloading the Nvidia driver module without rebooting by running `sudo modprobe -r nvidia` followed by `sudo modprobe nvidia`. This method might work in some cases, but a reboot is generally recommended to ensure consistency and stability."

","Q: Where should the two lines that set up the environment path be added to for new terminals and future logins to still be able to find these CUDA library files?
A: To make the two lines that set up the environment path (`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` and `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:${PATH}`) persist across new terminals and future logins, you should add them to one of the following configuration files:

**For Bash shells:**

1. `~/.bashrc` (if you are using a Bash shell)
2. `~/.profile` (this is also sourced by `.bash_profile`, but it's generally more recommended)

**For Zsh shells:**

1. `~/.zshrc`
2. `~/.zprofile`

When you add these lines to any of these files, new terminals will automatically source them when they start up, and future logins will also include the changes in their environment.

Here's how to do it:

1. Open your chosen configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) using your preferred text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `emacs`).
2. Add the two lines at the end of the file, right before the last line (`exit 0`, if you're editing `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).
3. Save and close the file.

Next time you open a new terminal window or log in to your system, these changes should take effect and make CUDA libraries available to your programs.

Example for adding it to `~/.bashrc` (if you are using Bash):
```
$ nano ~/.bashrc

# ... existing content ...

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:${PATH}

# ... exit 0 should be already there ...

","Q: What is the name of the file used by wget to download the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-535.104.05-grid.run driver installer?
A: The file used by `wget` to download the NVIDIA driver installer is:

```bash
https://storage.googleapis.com/nvidia-drivers-us-public/GRID/vGPU16.1/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-535.104.05-grid.run
```

This is a specific version of the driver, so if you want to download a different version or architecture (e.g., 32-bit), you'll need to use a different URL.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're having trouble with `wget` due to network issues or authentication errors, try using the `-c` option to resume an interrupted download:
```bash
wget -c https://.../NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-535.104.05-grid.run
```
This will restart the download from where it left off.

**Example Outside of Content:** Let's say you want to download a different version of the driver, like `NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-515.65.01`. You can use the following URL:
```bash
https://storage.googleapis.com/nvidia-drivers-us-public/GRID/vGPU16.1/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-515.65.01-grid.run
```

","Q: Which command disables GSP?
A: The command that disables GSP (Graphics Startup Process) is:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf
echo ""options nvidia NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0"" | sudo tee --append /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf
```

This command adds a new line to the `/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf` file, which tells the `nvidia` module to disable GSP."

# Start a node with Docker

You can run all the commands in this document without any change on any machine with the latest Docker and at least 8GB of RAM available to the container.
By default, the container uses the CPU to perform computations, which could be slow for large LLMs. For GPUs,

* Mac: Everything here works on [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). However, the Apple GPU cores will not be available inside Docker containers until [WebGPU is supported by Docker](https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge/blob/main/docker/webgpu.md) later in 2024.
* Windows and Linux with Nvidia GPU: You will need to install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#installation) for Docker. In the instructions below, replace the `latest` tag with `cuda12` or `cuda11` to use take advantage of the GPU, and add the `--device nvidia.com/gpu=all` flag. If you need to build the images yourself, replace `Dockerfile` with `Dockerfile.cuda12` or `Dockerfile.cuda11`.

Find [GaiaNet Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/?namespace=gaianet) you can run!

## Quick start

Start a Docker container for the GaiaNet node. It will print running logs from the GaiaNet node in this terminal. 

```
docker run --name gaianet \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/root/gaianet/qdrant/storage:z \
  gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest
```

The node is ready when it shows `The GaiaNet node is started at: https://...` on the console.
You can go to that URL from your browser to interact with the GaiaNet node.

The docker image contains the LLM and embedding models required by the node. However, the vector
collection snapshot (i.e., knowledge base) is downloaded and imported at the time when the node
starts up. That is because the knowledge based could be updated frequently. The `qdrant_storage`
directory on the host machine stores the vector database content.

Alternatively, the command to run the GaiaNet on your Nvidia CUDA 12 machine is as follows.

```
docker run --name gaianet \
  -p 8080:8080 --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \
  -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/root/gaianet/qdrant/storage:z \
  gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:cuda12
```

## Stop and re-start

You can stop and re-start the node as follows. Every time you re-start, it will re-initailize the vector
collection (knowledge base).

```
docker stop gaianet
docker start gaianet
```

NOTE: When you restart the node, the log messages will no longer be printed to the console.
You will need to wait for a few minutes before the restarted node comes back online. You can still see
the logs by logging into the container as follows.

```
docker exec -it gaianet /bin/bash
tail -f /root/gaianet/log/start-llamaedge.log
```

You can also delete the node if you no longer needs it.

```
docker stop gaianet
docker rm gaianet
```

## Make changes to the node

You can update the configuration parameters of the node, such as context size for the models, by
executing the `config` command on the `gaianet` program inside the container.
For example, the following command changes the chat LLM's context size to 8192 tokens.

```
docker exec -it gaianet /root/gaianet/bin/gaianet config --chat-ctx-size 8192
```

Then, restart the node for the new configuration to take effect.
You will need to wait for a few minutes for the server to start again, or you can monitor
the log files inside the container as discussed above.

```
docker stop gaianet
docker start gaianet
```

## Change the node ID

You can update the node ID (Ethereum address) associated with the node. Start the node and copy the `nodeid.json`
file, as well as the keystore file defined in `nodeid.json` into the container.

```
docker cp /local/path/to/nodeid.json gaianet:/root/gaianet/nodeid.json
docker cp /local/path/to/1234-abcd-key-store gaianet:/root/gaianet/1234-abcd-key-store
```

THen, restart the node for the new address and keystore to take effect.

```
docker stop gaianet
docker start gaianet
```

## Build a node image locally

Each GaiaNet is defined by a `config.json` file. It defines the node's required
LLM and embedding models, model parameters,
prompts, and vector snapshots (e.g., knowledge base). 
The following command builds a Docker image with two platforms 
for a node based on the specified `config.json` file. 

```
docker buildx build . --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 \
  --tag gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest -f Dockerfile \
  --build-arg CONFIG_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/config.json
```

> The `Dockerfile` is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/docker/Dockerfile). Feel free to change it to Nvidia [CUDA versions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/docker/Dockerfile.cuda12) if your Docker is enabled with the [Nvidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

You can publish your node for other people to use it.

```
docker push gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest
```

Good luck!

","Summary:

","Q: What is the minimum amount of RAM required to run a Docker container for GaiaNet?
A: According to the context, at least 8GB of RAM is required for the Docker container. This is specified in the ""Quick start"" section where it says:

""You can run all the commands in this document without any change on any machine with the latest Docker and at least 8GB of RAM available to the container.""

This suggests that having more than 8GB of RAM will provide better performance, especially for large LLMs (Large Language Models), but 8GB is the minimum requirement."

","Q: How can Mac users use an Apple GPU with Docker containers?
A: Unfortunately, Mac users cannot currently use an Apple GPU with Docker containers. According to the documentation you provided earlier, it states that ""The Apple GPU cores will not be available inside Docker containers until [WebGPU is supported by Docker] later in 2024.""

This means that even if you have a Mac with an Apple GPU, such as an M1 or M2 chip, you won't be able to use it for GPU acceleration within a Docker container at this time.

However, there are some workarounds and alternative solutions available:

1. **Use software-based emulation**: Some applications can utilize software-based emulation of the Apple GPU, which might provide limited performance benefits.
2. **Run containers on other machines**: If you have access to another machine with an NVIDIA or AMD GPU, you can run your Docker container there, leveraging their GPU capabilities.
3. **Wait for WebGPU support**: As mentioned earlier, WebGPU support is expected to arrive in Docker later in 2024. Once this happens, Apple GPUs might become available within Docker containers.

Please keep an eye on the official Docker and WebGPU announcements for updates on this feature."

You can update the configuration parameters of the node, such as context size for the models, by
executing the `config` command on the `gaianet` program inside the container.
For example, the following command changes the chat LLM's context size to 8192 tokens.

```
docker exec -it gaianet /root/gaianet/bin/gaianet config --chat-ctx-size 8192
```

Then, restart the node for the new configuration to take effect.
You will need to wait for a few minutes for the server to start again, or you can monitor
the log files inside the container as discussed above.

```
docker stop gaianet
docker start gaianet
```

## Change the node ID

You can update the node ID (Ethereum address) associated with the node. Start the node and copy the `nodeid.json`
file, as well as the keystore file defined in `nodeid.json` into the container.

```
docker cp /local/path/to/nodeid.json gaianet:/root/gaianet/nodeid.json
docker cp /local/path/to/1234-abcd-key-store gaianet:/root/gaianet/1234-abcd-key-store
```

THen, restart the node for the new address and keystore to take effect.

```
docker stop gaianet
docker start gaianet
```

## Build a node image locally

Each GaiaNet is defined by a `config.json` file. It defines the node's required
LLM and embedding models, model parameters,
prompts, and vector snapshots (e.g., knowledge base). 
The following command builds a Docker image with two platforms 
for a node based on the specified `config.json` file. 

```
docker buildx build . --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 \
  --tag gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest -f Dockerfile \
  --build-arg CONFIG_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/config.json
```

> The `Dockerfile` is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/docker/Dockerfile). Feel free to change it to Nvidia [CUDA versions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/docker/Dockerfile.cuda12) if your Docker is enabled with the [Nvidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

You can publish your node for other people to use it.

```
docker push gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest
```

Good luck!

","Q: What is the alternative command for running a GaiaNet node on a Windows or Linux machine with an Nvidia CUDA 12 environment?
A: The alternative command for running a GaiaNet node on a Windows or Linux machine with an Nvidia CUDA 12 environment is as follows:

```
docker run --name gaianet \
  -p 8080:8080 --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \
  -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/root/gaianet/qdrant/storage:z \
  gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:cuda12
```

Note that you need to replace `cuda12` with your CUDA version, and also install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) for Docker.

Also, be aware that the `--device nvidia.com/gpu=all` flag is required to enable GPU acceleration in the container."

# Start a node with Docker

You can run all the commands in this document without any change on any machine with the latest Docker and at least 8GB of RAM available to the container.
By default, the container uses the CPU to perform computations, which could be slow for large LLMs. For GPUs,

* Mac: Everything here works on [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). However, the Apple GPU cores will not be available inside Docker containers until [WebGPU is supported by Docker](https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge/blob/main/docker/webgpu.md) later in 2024.
* Windows and Linux with Nvidia GPU: You will need to install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#installation) for Docker. In the instructions below, replace the `latest` tag with `cuda12` or `cuda11` to use take advantage of the GPU, and add the `--device nvidia.com/gpu=all` flag. If you need to build the images yourself, replace `Dockerfile` with `Dockerfile.cuda12` or `Dockerfile.cuda11`.

Find [GaiaNet Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/?namespace=gaianet) you can run!

## Quick start

Start a Docker container for the GaiaNet node. It will print running logs from the GaiaNet node in this terminal. 

```
docker run --name gaianet \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/root/gaianet/qdrant/storage:z \
  gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest
```

The node is ready when it shows `The GaiaNet node is started at: https://...` on the console.
You can go to that URL from your browser to interact with the GaiaNet node.

The docker image contains the LLM and embedding models required by the node. However, the vector
collection snapshot (i.e., knowledge base) is downloaded and imported at the time when the node
starts up. That is because the knowledge based could be updated frequently. The `qdrant_storage`
directory on the host machine stores the vector database content.

Alternatively, the command to run the GaiaNet on your Nvidia CUDA 12 machine is as follows.

```
docker run --name gaianet \
  -p 8080:8080 --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \
  -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/root/gaianet/qdrant/storage:z \
  gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:cuda12
```

## Stop and re-start

You can stop and re-start the node as follows. Every time you re-start, it will re-initailize the vector
collection (knowledge base).

```
docker stop gaianet
docker start gaianet
```

NOTE: When you restart the node, the log messages will no longer be printed to the console.
You will need to wait for a few minutes before the restarted node comes back online. You can still see
the logs by logging into the container as follows.

```
docker exec -it gaianet /bin/bash
tail -f /root/gaianet/log/start-llamaedge.log
```

You can also delete the node if you no longer needs it.

```
docker stop gaianet
docker rm gaianet
```

## Make changes to the node

You can update the configuration parameters of the node, such as context size for the models, by
executing the `config` command on the `gaianet` program inside the container.
For example, the following command changes the chat LLM's context size to 8192 tokens.

```
docker exec -it gaianet /root/gaianet/bin/gaianet config --chat-ctx-size 8192
```

You will need to wait for a few minutes for the server to start again, or you can monitor
the log files inside the container as discussed above.

```
docker stop gaianet
docker start gaianet
```

## Change the node ID

You can update the node ID (Ethereum address) associated with the node. Start the node and copy the `nodeid.json`
file, as well as the keystore file defined in `nodeid.json` into the container.

```
docker cp /local/path/to/nodeid.json gaianet:/root/gaianet/nodeid.json
docker cp /local/path/to/1234-abcd-key-store gaianet:/root/gaianet/1234-abcd-key-store

You can publish your node for other people to use it.

```
docker push gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest
```

Good luck!

","Q: Where can you find Gaianet Docker images that can be run?
A: You can find Gaianet Docker images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Specifically, you can search for the `gaianet` repository to see a list of available images.

Here is an example URL where you can find Gaianet Docker images:

```
https://hub.docker.com/?namespace=gaianet
```

This will take you directly to the Gaianet Docker images page on Docker Hub. From there, you can browse and select the image that meets your needs.

Alternatively, you can also use the `docker pull` command in the terminal to fetch a specific Gaianet image. For example:

```bash
docker pull gaianet/phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris:latest
```

This will download the latest version of the `phi-3-mini-instruct-4k_paris` image from Docker Hub.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're having trouble finding the exact image you need, try using the `docker search` command to search for Gaianet-related images:

```bash
docker search gaianet
```

This will give you a list of available images that match your search query."

# Run a local-only node

By default, the GaiaNet node registers itself with a GaiaNet domain and is accesible from the public.
For many users, it could also be important to start a local server for testing. To do that, you just
need to pass the `--local-only` option.

```
gaianet start --local-only
```

","Summary:
This text describes how to run a local-only GaiaNet node. Here is a summary:

**Goal:** Run a GaiaNet node that is not accessible from the public.

**Step 1:** Use the `gaianet start` command with the additional option `--local-only`.

**Example Command:** `gaianet start --local-only`

By running this command, you can start a local-only GaiaNet node for testing purposes."

# Run a local-only node

By default, the GaiaNet node registers itself with a GaiaNet domain and is accesible from the public.
For many users, it could also be important to start a local server for testing. To do that, you just
need to pass the `--local-only` option.

```
gaianet start --local-only
```

","Q: Can the local node be run with the command line?
A: Yes, you can run a local-only GaiaNet node using the command line with the `--local-only` option.

Here's how you can do it:

```
gaianet start --local-only
```

This command will start a GaiaNet node that is only accessible from your local machine, and not registered on any public network. This is useful for testing purposes or when you want to run the GaiaNet locally without exposing it to the internet.

**Bonus Tip:** You can also specify additional options with the `gaianet start` command. For example, if you want to start a node with a specific port number, you can use the `--port` option:

```bash
gaianet start --local-only --port 8080
```

This will start a local GaiaNet node on port 8080. You can experiment with different options and configurations to suit your needs.

**Example outside of the content:** Suppose you're developing a web application that interacts with GaiaNet, and you want to test it locally without affecting the public GaiaNet instance. By running a local-only node using the `--local-only` option, you can create a testing environment where your application can connect to the local GaiaNet instance, ensuring that your tests are isolated from the public network.

In this example, let's say you have a web application written in Python that interacts with GaiaNet. Your application is configured to connect to the public GaiaNet instance by default. To test your application locally without affecting the public network, you can run a local-only GaiaNet node using the `--local-only` option:

```bash
gaianet start --local-only
```

Then, in your web application, update the connection settings to point to the local GaiaNet instance (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). This allows you to test your application locally without exposing it to the internet."

need to pass the `--local-only` option.

```

```

","Q: Is GaiaNet accessible from the public by default?
A: Yes, GaiaNet is accessible from the public by default. When you start a GaiaNet node without any specific configuration or options, it registers itself with a GaiaNet domain and becomes visible to anyone on the internet.

This means that when you run `gaianet start` without any additional flags, your local GaiaNet node can be accessed by other users on the public network. However, if you want to restrict access to your local node for testing purposes, you can use the `--local-only` option to prevent it from registering with the public domain.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're concerned about security and only need to test GaiaNet in a local environment, it's a good idea to set up a virtual private network (VPN) or a firewall rule to restrict access to your node. This will add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. For example, you can use a tool like `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Ubuntu-based systems to block incoming traffic from the public.

Example:
```bash
# Block incoming traffic on port 8080 (default GaiaNet port)
sudo ufw deny in on eth0 to any port 8080
```
This will prevent anyone outside your local network from accessing your GaiaNet node."

```

```

","Q: How is the local-only option passed to the gaianet start command?
A: The local-only option is passed to the `gaianet start` command by including the `--local-only` flag after the command. This flag instructs the GaiaNet node to run in a local-only mode, making it inaccessible from the public and only accessible on the local machine.

Example:
```
gaianet start --local-only
```

**Bonus Tip:** You can also use the short form of the option by passing `-l` instead of `--local-only`. This is a common convention in many command-line tools, where a single dash followed by a letter corresponds to a specific long-option flag.

Example:
```bash
gaianet start -l
```

This can be useful if you're used to typing shorter options or if you need to type the command quickly. However, using the full option name `--local-only` is generally more readable and self-explanatory."

","Q: Is --local-only a required argument for starting the node?
A: No, `--local-only` is not a required argument for starting the node. According to the provided information, it's an optional argument that needs to be passed if you want to start a local server for testing purposes.

You can start the GaiaNet node without specifying this flag and it will still work as default, registering itself with a GaiaNet domain and being accessible from the public.

Here's an example:

```bash
gaianet start
```

This command would run the GaiaNet node in its default configuration."

","Q: What happens if no options are provided when running the node?
A: If no options are provided when running the node, it will behave as if the default values were specified. In this case, the GaiaNet node will register itself with a GaiaNet domain and be accessible from the public.

This means that, by default, the node will not start in local-only mode, but instead, it will:

1. Register itself on the public GaiaNet network.
2. Allow connections and requests from the internet.

**Bonus Tip:** To avoid accidentally exposing your local node to the public, always use the `--local-only` flag when starting a new node for testing or development purposes. This ensures that your node is not accessible from outside your local network.

**Example Outside of Context:**

Imagine you have a server running in your home network and it's exposed to the internet by mistake. An attacker might find and exploit a vulnerability in your server, putting sensitive data at risk. In this scenario, having a local-only node (or any service for that matter) can prevent such security breaches by restricting access only to trusted devices within your local network."

","Q: Does registering with GaiaNet domain affect performance?
A: Registering with a GaiaNet domain and making your node accessible from the public does have some implications on performance. Here's why:

1.  **Increased latency**: When your local-only node is registered with the public GaiaNet domain, it needs to establish connections over the internet. This introduces network latency, which can slow down transactions between nodes.
2.  **Higher resource usage**: Registering with the public domain requires more resources (e.g., CPU, memory, and bandwidth) because your node needs to handle incoming requests from other nodes on the network.
3.  **Security considerations**: Exposing your node to the public internet increases the attack surface, making it a potential target for malicious actors.

To mitigate these performance-related concerns, running a local-only node is an excellent approach. By using the `--local-only` option, you can:

*   **Reduce latency**: Local connections are typically faster than internet connections.
*   **Conserve resources**: Your node only needs to handle requests within your local network.
*   **Enhance security**: By limiting access to your node, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks.

Here's an example use case:

Suppose you're developing a GaiaNet-based application and want to test its functionality locally. You start a local-only node using `gaianet start --local-only`. This allows you to simulate transactions between nodes without exposing your node to the public internet, making it easier to debug and optimize your application.

**Bonus tip:** When running a local-only node for development purposes, consider setting up multiple instances with different configurations (e.g., one instance with a specific network configuration or another instance with a custom set of plugins). This allows you to quickly switch between different environments without affecting the production setup."

","Q: Can the local server be stopped after it has been started?
A: Yes, the local server can be stopped after it has been started. Since the GaiaNet node is a process that runs in the background, you can stop it using standard process management commands.

To stop the local-only GaiaNet node that was started with `gaianet start --local-only`, you can use the following command:

```bash
pkill gaianet
```

This will kill the gaianet process and shut down the server. 

**Bonus Tip:**

When running a local-only node, it's essential to remember that this is a development or testing environment, not intended for public exposure. Be cautious when exposing any system to untrusted networks or users.

Additionally, consider using `--pidfile` option to specify a file where the process ID will be written, which can make it easier to manage and stop the GaiaNet node in the future.

```bash
gaianet start --local-only --pidfile=/tmp/gaianet.pid
```

This way you can easily kill the process by running `kill $(cat /tmp/gaianet.pid)`."

A: Yes, the example command to start a local node is provided directly in the context:

```bash

```

This command will allow you to run GaiaNet on your local machine and make it accessible only locally for testing purposes.

**Bonus Tip:** When running a local node, be sure to check that your system's firewall settings are not blocking incoming connections. If your firewall is enabled, you might need to add an exception or rule to allow the local GaiaNet server to receive connections."

need to pass the `--local-only` option.

```
gaianet start --local-only
```

","Q: How does the --local-only option differ from other available options?
A: The `--local-only` option differs from other available options in that it specifically restricts the GaiaNet node to only operate locally, without registering itself with a GaiaNet domain or exposing its services to the public.

Other options, such as those controlling logging levels, node names, or port numbers, are typically used to customize the behavior of the GaiaNet node for specific use cases or environments. They do not have the same level of impact on how the node interacts with the outside world as the `--local-only` option does.

For example, the `--name` option allows you to specify a custom name for your GaiaNet node, while the `--log-level` option controls the verbosity of log messages. In contrast, the `--local-only` option effectively disables the node's ability to communicate with other nodes or external services outside of its local environment.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

* Running a GaiaNet node with the default options (without `--local-only`) allows it to interact with the global GaiaNet network and be accessible from anywhere. This is useful for testing and development purposes, as well as when deploying the service in a production environment.
```bash
gaianet start
```
* Running a GaiaNet node with the `--local-only` option restricts its operation to only within the local machine, without exposing it to the public or registering it with the global network. This is useful for development, testing, and sandbox environments where you don't want external access or interference.

Bonus tip: When running multiple GaiaNet nodes on a single machine (e.g., for testing different configurations or scenarios), consider using separate virtual networks or subnets to isolate each node's traffic and prevent conflicts or interference. This can be achieved using tools like Docker, VirtualBox, or VMware, depending on your environment and requirements.

Example:

* Run multiple GaiaNet nodes with `--local-only` option in separate Docker containers:
```bash
docker run -d --name node1 gaianet start --local-only
docker run -d --name node2 gaianet start --local-only
```
This allows each node to operate independently, while still being contained within the local machine."

```

","Q: Does starting the local node disable any security features?
A: Starting a local-only node using the `--local-only` option does not inherently disable any security features. This mode is primarily used for testing and development purposes, allowing you to run a GaiaNet node locally without it being exposed to the public.

However, because a local-only node is not accessible from the outside, some of the default security features might be less relevant or redundant in this context. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Security through obscurity**: Since the local node isn't publicly reachable, its IP address and port aren't exposed to potential attackers.
2. **Firewall configurations**: By default, your system firewall may block incoming connections to a local-only GaiaNet instance, providing some level of security.
3. **GaiaNet domain registration**: When you start a local-only node, it doesn't register itself with the public GaiaNet domain, which reduces its exposure.

Despite these factors, consider the following:

* **Internal risks**: You should still ensure that your local machine and network are properly secured against potential internal threats.
* **Data protection**: Any data stored or processed by your local GaiaNet node is not automatically encrypted. Make sure to use secure storage solutions for sensitive information.

To maximize security when running a local-only GaiaNet node, follow these best practices:

### Bonus Tip

1. **Use strong authentication and authorization**:
	* Configure robust password policies (e.g., using a password manager) to secure access to your GaiaNet instance.
	* Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to manage user permissions.
2. **Regularly update and patch**: Stay up-to-date with the latest GaiaNet versions, as newer releases often include security patches.
3. **Monitor system logs**: Keep an eye on system logs for suspicious activity.

### Example use case

Suppose you're a developer working on a project that involves testing your application's interactions with GaiaNet. You can start a local-only GaiaNet node using the `--local-only` option, allowing you to test and verify your app's functionality without exposing it to public networks:

```bash
gaianet start --local-only
```

With this setup, you'll be able to ensure that your application communicates correctly with the local GaiaNet instance while minimizing potential security risks."

```
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-2
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2
```

","Summary:
This is a documentation section on installing multiple nodes of GaiaNet, a distributed network technology, on the same machine. Here's a comprehensive summary:

**Key Points**

1. The default installer for GaiaNet installs nodes in the `$HOME/gaianet` base directory.
2. To install multiple nodes on the same machine, you can use the `--base` option to specify a different base directory for each node.
3. Each node has its own ""base directory"".

**Installation Command**

To install GaiaNet node software with a custom base directory, use the following command:
```bash
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/node-2
```
Replace `$HOME/node-2` with your desired base directory.

**Using the `gaianet` CLI**

To operate on a specific node (e.g., `node-2`) using the `gaianet` CLI, append the `--base` option to each command:
```bash
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-2
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2

gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2
```

","Q: How do I install multiple nodes on a single machine?
A: To install multiple nodes on a single machine, you can use the `--base` option with the GaiaNet installer. This will create a new ""base directory"" for each node, allowing you to run and manage multiple nodes independently.

Here's an example of how to do it:

Let's say you want to install two nodes on your machine: one at `$HOME/gaianet-1` and another at `$HOME/gaianet-2`. You can use the following commands:

```
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/gaianet-1
```

This command will install GaiaNet node software in `$HOME/gaianet-1`. Then, you can specify the `gaianet` CLI to operate on this node by appending the `--base` option as well.

For the second node:

```bash
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/gaianet-2
```

Now you have two nodes installed on your machine, each with its own base directory. You can run and manage them independently using the `gaianet` CLI.

**Bonus Tip:**
When installing multiple nodes on a single machine, make sure to use a unique name for each node's base directory (e.g., `$HOME/gaianet-1`, `$HOME/gaianet-2`, etc.). This will help you keep track of the nodes and their configuration. Additionally, consider using a naming convention that indicates the purpose or version of each node.

**Example Outside of Content:**
Suppose you're working on a project with multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) and want to install separate GaiaNet nodes for each environment on your local machine. You could use a naming convention like `$HOME/env-[env]-gaianet` where `[env]` is the environment name (e.g., `dev`, `stg`, `prod`). This way, you can easily manage multiple nodes with distinct configurations and purposes."

","Q: Can I use the default GaiaNet installer to install multiple nodes?
A: No, you cannot use the default GaiaNet installer to install multiple nodes on a single machine. The default installer installs the node into the `$HOME/gaianet` base directory and does not provide an option to install multiple nodes.

However, as explained in the provided context, you can still install multiple nodes on the same machine by using the `--base` option with the default installer command. Each node will have its own ""base directory"", and you can specify the `--base` option for each node installation command.

Here is an example of installing two separate nodes using the default installer:

1. Install the first node into `$HOME/gaianet`:
```bash
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/gaianet
```
2. Install the second node into `$HOME/node-2`:
```bash
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/node-2
```

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to replace `$HOME/gaianet` and `$HOME/node-2` with your desired base directories for each node. Also, keep in mind that each node will have its own separate configuration files and data directories.

For example, if you're using the `--base $HOME/node-2` command to install a second node, the configuration file for the second node would be located at `$HOME/node-2/config.json`."

","Q: What is the base directory for each node in a multi-node setup?
A: In a multi-node setup, each node has its own unique base directory. This is the directory where the GaiaNet node software will be installed and all related files will reside.

When you install multiple nodes on the same machine using the `--base` option, as shown in the example, you specify a different base directory for each node.

For instance:

* The first node has a base directory of `$HOME/gaianet`
* The second node has a base directory of `$HOME/node-2`

Each node's base directory is completely isolated from the others, and all files related to that node will be stored within its respective base directory.

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to keep your base directories organized and easily identifiable. You can use descriptive names like `$HOME/gaianet-1`, `$HOME/node-2`, `$HOME/gaianet-3` for each node, making it easier to track and manage multiple nodes on the same machine."

However, if you want to manage and keep track of your nodes separately (for example, to upgrade or maintain different versions of GaiaNet), using a separate `--base` option for each node is recommended.

By not specifying the `--base` option, multiple instances will overwrite the previous ones. 

Here are some examples:

**Default installation:**
```bash
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash

curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/node-2
```

**Example 2: Running both nodes**

We want to initialize and start the first node using its base directory.

```bash
# Initialize first node in $HOME/node-1
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-1

# Start first node
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-1
```

And we also want to initialize and start the second node using its base directory.

```bash
# Initialize second node in $HOME/node-2
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-2

# Start second node
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2
```

**Bonus Tip:**

When running multiple nodes on a single machine, make sure to configure the network settings for each node correctly. You might need to modify the `etc/hosts` file or update the networking configuration to ensure that each node has its own separate network identity.

Remember to carefully check and follow any specific requirements for your particular use case, such as node-specific configuration files or custom scripts."

# Install multiple nodes on a single machine

The [default GaiaNet installer](../quick-start) installs the node into the `$HOME/gaianet` base directory. 
You could install multiple nodes on the same machine. Each node has its own ""base directory"".
To do that, you just need to use the `--base` option. 

Let's say that the base directory for your second node is `$HOME/node-2`.
You can install GaiaNet node software using the following command.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/node-2
```

After that, you can specify the `gaianet` CLI to operate on `node-2` by appending the `--base` option as well.

```
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-2
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2
```

","Q: What is the command syntax for specifying a different base directory for a GaiaNet node?
A: The command syntax for specifying a different base directory for a GaiaNet node is as follows:

`curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/node-2`

This command installs the GaiaNet node software in the specified base directory, which in this case is `$HOME/node-2`.

Additionally, when operating on a specific node (e.g., `node-2`), you need to specify the base directory using the `--base` option with the `gaianet` CLI command.

Example:
```
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-2
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2
```

**Bonus Tip:** When specifying a different base directory, make sure to update your environment variables (e.g., `$PATH`) if necessary. You can use the `source` command in Linux/Mac or `call` in Windows to reload the updated environment variables.

For example:
```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
export PATH=$HOME/node-2/bin:$PATH
```

This ensures that your shell is aware of the new base directory and its contents."

gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2
```

","Q: Can I use environment variables to set the base directory for a GaiaNet node?
A: Yes, you can use environment variables to set the base directory for a GaiaNet node. 

By default, when you install GaiaNet using the `--base` option, it sets the `$GAIANET_BASE_DIR` environment variable to the specified base directory path.

For example, if you run:

```bash
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/main/install.sh' | bash -s -- --base $HOME/node-2
```

Then after that, the environment variable `$GAIANET_BASE_DIR` will be set to `/home/yourusername/node-2`.

After installation, you can use this environment variable in place of a fixed path when running GaiaNet CLI commands. For example:

```bash
gaianet init --base $GAIANET_BASE_DIR
```

**Bonus tip:**

To make it even easier to switch between nodes, you can define multiple `GAIANET_BASE_DIR` environment variables for different nodes and source them using the `source` command before running GaiaNet CLI commands. This way, you don't have to specify the base directory for each node every time.

For example:

```bash
export GAIANET_NODE1_BASE_DIR=$HOME/node-1
export GAIANET_NODE2_BASE_DIR=$HOME/node-2

# Now you can switch between nodes using these environment variables.
source $GAIANET_NODE1_BASE_DIR/bin/activate  # Activate the node-1 env
gaianet init --base $GAIANET_NODE1_BASE_DIR
```

This approach makes it easy to manage and switch between different GaiaNet nodes on your machine."

","Q: How do I specify which node's CLI commands should be executed using the `gaianet` command?
A: To specify which node's CLI commands should be executed using the `gaianet` command, you can use the `--base` option. 

As mentioned in the context, when you install multiple nodes on the same machine, each node has its own ""base directory"". You need to specify the base directory for the particular node whose CLI commands you want to execute.

For example, let's say that the base directories of two nodes are `$HOME/node-1` and `$HOME/node-2`. 

You can specify the first node by executing the following command:

```bash
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-1
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-1
```

Similarly, you can specify the second node as follows:

```bash
gaianet init --base $HOME/node-2
gaianet start --base $HOME/node-2
```

In both cases, the `--base` option is used to specify the base directory for the particular node whose CLI commands are being executed.

**Bonus Tip:** When using the `gaianet` command, you can also use the `$GAIA_NET_HOME` environment variable to set the base directory instead of hardcoding it in each command. This makes it easier to manage and switch between different nodes.

For example:

```bash
export GAIA_NET_HOME=$HOME/node-1
gaianet init
```

This sets the `GAIA_NET_HOME` environment variable to `$HOME/node-1`, and then executes the `init` command on that node."

","Q: Are there any limitations or considerations when installing multiple nodes on a single machine?
A: When installing multiple nodes on a single machine, there are several limitations and considerations to keep in mind:

1.  **Resource contention**: Multiple nodes running on the same machine will contend for resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. This may lead to performance degradation or even crashes if not managed properly.
2.  **Base directory conflicts**: Each node has its own base directory, but there's a risk of conflicts if you're using the same absolute path for multiple nodes (e.g., both `$HOME/gaianet` and `$HOME/node-2`). Consider using unique paths or symlinks to avoid issues.
3.  **Networking configuration**: If you have multiple nodes on the same machine, ensure that their network configurations are set up correctly to communicate with each other or external peers. This includes setting up distinct IP addresses, port numbers, and firewall rules as needed.
4.  **Logging and monitoring**: With multiple nodes running on a single machine, it can be challenging to manage logging and monitoring. Consider using centralized logging solutions or tools like Splunk, ELK, or Prometheus to monitor the health and performance of your nodes.
5.  **Security**: When running multiple nodes on the same machine, ensure that each node has its own unique identity, and consider implementing additional security measures such as encryption, access controls, or firewalls to prevent unauthorized access.
6.  **Upgrade and maintenance**: Managing upgrades and maintenance for multiple nodes can be complex. Plan your upgrade and maintenance cycles carefully to avoid downtime or conflicts between nodes.

Bonus tip: When installing multiple nodes on a single machine, consider using virtualization tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or Virtual Machines (VMs) to create isolated environments for each node. This will help improve resource utilization, reduce conflicts, and enhance manageability.

Example use case:

Suppose you're running a development environment with multiple GaiaNet nodes, each representing a different network topology or configuration. By using virtualization tools like Docker, you can create isolated containers for each node, ensuring that they don't interfere with each other's resources or configurations. This approach allows for efficient testing and experimentation without worrying about conflicts or resource contention.

By understanding these limitations and considerations, you can better manage multiple nodes on a single machine and ensure smooth operation of your GaiaNet network."

Good luck!

","Summary:
**Protecting the Server Process**

The `wasmedge` process on a GaiaNet node may be killed by the Operating System (OS) if it consumes too many resources. To prevent this, it's essential to protect the server process.

**Using Supervise**

One way to achieve this is by using the `supervise` tool, which can monitor the `wasmedge` process and automatically restart it in case it dies or is killed. The `gaianet` CLI will utilize `supervise` automatically if it's installed on the system.

**Installation of Supervise**

To install `supervise`, follow these steps:

* For **macOS** users, run the following command to install `daemontools`: `brew install daemontools`
* For **Linux** users, refer to the installation guide: [https://cr.yp.to/daemontools/install.html](https://cr.yp.to/daemontools/install.html)

**Reducing Nice Value**

If `supervise` is too aggressive, you can try increasing the priority of the `wasmedge` process by reducing its nice value. This tells the OS to prioritize this process until it's absolutely necessary.

To reduce the nice value, run the following command:
```bash
sudo renice -n -19 $(cat $HOME/gaianet/llamaedge.pid)
```
By following these steps, you can ensure that your `wasmedge` process remains running and protected on your GaiaNet node."

","Q: What should you protect on a production server according to the text?
A: According to the text, you should protect the `wasmedge` process on a production server. This is because the OS might kill the process if it consumes too many resources.

**Bonus Tip:** Protecting critical processes like `wasmedge` can be achieved by setting up a restart policy for the process when it crashes or is terminated abnormally. This ensures that your production server continues to function smoothly even in the event of process failures.

For example, you could use systemd (on Linux systems) to configure a restart policy for the `wasmedge` service:

```
sudo systemctl edit wasmedgeservice.service
```

Add the following configuration to specify that the `wasmedge` service should be restarted when it fails:

```
[Service]
Restart=always
```

This way, if the `wasmedge` process crashes or is terminated abnormally, systemd will automatically restart it."

Example:
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wasmedge.service
systemctl start wasmedge.service
```

2. **Upstart**: Upstart is an event-driven init system for Linux operating systems. It provides features such as automatic restarting of services on failure, and it can be used to supervise the `wasmedge` process.

Example:
```
sudo start upstart job wasmedge.conf
```

3. **Monit**: Monit is a monitoring tool that can be used to supervise processes and automatically restart them in case they fail or die. It's available for multiple platforms, including Linux and macOS.

Example (on Linux):
```
sudo monit daemon
sudo monit add -s -i /path/to/wasmedge.pid process wasmedge
```

4. **System V init**: System V init is a system initialization tool that can be used to manage services and supervise processes.

Example:
```
sudo chkconfig --level 2345 wasmedge on
sudo service wasmedge start
```

","Q: What is the purpose of reducing the nice value of a process according to the text?
A: According to the text, reducing the nice value of a process is done so that ""the OS will try NOT to kill high priority processes until it absolutely has to."" This means that by setting a lower nice value, the `wasmedge` process will be given higher priority and less likely to be killed by the operating system in case it consumes too many resources. 

**Bonus Tip:** The nice value is a way for the operating system to control how much of the CPU time is allocated to a particular process. It's not an absolute priority, but rather a relative one. A lower nice value (i.e., -19) means that the process will get more CPU time compared to other processes with higher nice values.

**Example:** In a scenario where multiple `wasmedge` processes are running on a server and competing for resources, reducing the nice value of each instance can help ensure they all get enough CPU time to function properly, even if some instances consume more resources than others."

A: The command to reduce the nice value of wasmedge is:

```
sudo renice -n -19 $(cat $HOME/gaianet/llamaedge.pid)
```

This command uses `renice` to adjust the niceness (or priority) of the process identified by the pid in `$HOME/gaianet/llamaedge.pid`. The `-n -19` option tells `renice` to set the niceness to -19, which is a very high priority. Note that you need to be root or have sudo privileges to use `renice`.

**Bonus Tip:** You can use `ps aux | grep wasmedge` to find the pid of the wasmedge process and replace `$HOME/gaianet/llamaedge.pid` with the actual pid if it's different.

Example outside of this content:

Suppose you're running a web server that's using a high amount of CPU, but you need it to run at a higher priority than other processes. You can use `renice -n -19 <pid>` to increase its niceness and make sure the OS prioritizes it over other processes.

However, be aware that setting too high of a niceness (like -20) might have unintended consequences on system performance, especially if the process is resource-intensive or has bugs."

For macOS users, you can install `supervise` via the daemontools tool by running the following command.

```
brew install daemontools
```

For Linux users, please refer to [the installation guide](https://cr.yp.to/daemontools/install.html) to install the `daemontools` tool.

## Reduce the nice value

If the `supervise` tool is too heavy handed, we could also increase the priority of the `wasmedge` process. The OS
will try NOT to kill high priority processes until it absolutely has to. We do that by reducing the `nice` value
of the `wasmedge` process.

```
sudo renice -n -19 $(cat $HOME/gaianet/llamaedge.pid)
```

Good luck!

","Q: What type of operating system will the OS try NOT to kill high priority processes on?
A: According to the text, the OS will try NOT to kill high priority processes until it absolutely has to on both macOS and Linux operating systems.

So, in essence, there is no specific type of operating system that we can conclude from this question. However, we can confirm that the behavior applies to both macOS and Linux."

# Troubleshooting

## The system cannot find CUDA libraries

Sometimes, the CUDA toolkit is installed in a non-standard location. The error message here is often not able to find `libcu*12`. For example, you might have CUDA installed with your Python setup. The following command would install CUDA into Python's enviornment.

```
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install --upgrade fschat accelerate autoawq vllm
```

The easiest way to fix is simply to link those non-standard CUDA libraries to the standard location, like this.

```
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/libcublas.so.12 /usr/lib/libcublas.so.12
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cuda_runtime/lib/libcudart.so.12 /usr/lib/libcudart.so.12
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/libcublasLt.so.12 /usr/lib/libcublasLt.so.12
```

## Failed to recover from collection snapshot on Windows WSL

On Windows WSL, you could see this error while running `gaianet init`.

```

      The process may take a few minutes. Please wait ...
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Tokio task join error: task 1242 panicked""},""time"":0.697784244}
```

When you look into the `~/gaianet/log/init-qdrant.log` file, you could see this line of error

```
2024-05-20T07:24:52.900895Z ERROR qdrant::startup: Panic occurred in file /home/runner/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/cgroups-rs-0.3.4/src/memory.rs at line 587: called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: ReadFailed(""/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.high""), cause: Some(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: ""No such file or directory"" }) }  
```

The solution is to disable the `autoMemoryReclaim` feature in WSL. Step to turn on/off this feature:

1. Edit `C:\Users<Your user name>.wslconfig`
2. Remove or comment out `autoMemoryReclaim` in `[experimental]` section.

```

The solution is to run `gaianet stop`  first to kill all processes, and then run `gaianet start` to start the node.


## Load library failed: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


On Windows WSL, you may see this error when running `curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash`

```

```
The error is caused by the lack of `libgomp.so.1`, a library that should be automatically installed on Ubuntu by default.

To solve this, you must install the `libgomp.so.1` library.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgomp1
```

If you're using CentOS, you can use

```
yum install libgomp
```

This issue was fixed in `version 0.2.2`.

## Failed to remove the default collection

```
Failed to remove the default collection. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: No such file or directory (os error 2)""},""time"":0.050924542}
```

It typically indicates that the Qdrant instance was not shut down properly before you try to init it again with a new snapshot. The solution is to stop the GaiaNet node first.

```
gaianet stop
```

Alternatively, you could mannually kill the processes from the terminal or in the OS's Actvity Monitor.

```
sudo pkill -9 qdrant
sudo pkill -9 wasmedge
sudo pkill -9 frpc
```

Then you can run `gaianet init` and then `gaianet start` again.

## File I/O error

```
    * Import the Qdrant collection snapshot ...
      The process may take a few minutes. Please wait ...
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. An error occurred processing field `snapshot`: File I/O error: Operation not permitted (os error 1)

```

The reason for this type of error is a mis-configured `config.json` file. The solution is to delete the comments in `config.json` and re-run the `gaianet init` command.

## The ""Too many open files"" Error on macOS

When running `gaianet init` to initialize a new node on macOS, you may encounter an error related to snapshot recovery if your snapshot contains a large amount of text. The error message may be the following:

```
 * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
```

This issue is caused by the default file descriptor (FD) limit on macOS, which is set to a relatively low value of 256.

To resolve this issue, you can increase the default FD limit on your system. To do so, run the following command:

```
ulimit -n 10000
```

This will temporarily set the FD limit to 10,000. Next, use `gaianet init` and `gaianet start` commands in the SAME terminal.

## Permission denied when use the installer script to install WasmEdge

When running `curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash` to install GaiaNet node software, you may meet the permisson denied error especially installing the WasmEdge runtime. 

![](troubleshooting-01.png)

This error is caused by the lack of `/tmp` write permission. You can use `--tmpdir` to specify where you want to install the WasmEdge runtime. Please note, you will need to have written permission to the `<YOUR_PATH>` folder.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s -- --tmpdir YOUR_PATH
```

This problem is fixed in `version 0.2.3`.



","Summary:
This is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for issues encountered while using Gaianet node software. The document covers various error messages and solutions, including:

1. **The system cannot find CUDA libraries**: This issue arises when the CUDA toolkit is installed in a non-standard location. To resolve it, create symbolic links to standard locations.
2. **Failed to recover from collection snapshot on Windows WSL**: Disable the `autoMemoryReclaim` feature by editing the `wslconfig` file.
3. **Port 8080 is in use. Exit ...**: Stop all processes using port 8080 before starting the node again.
4. **Load library failed: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory**: Install the missing library on Ubuntu or CentOS systems.
5. **Failed to remove the default collection**: Stop the GaiaNet node and manually kill the processes if necessary.
6. **File I/O error**: Stop the GaiaNet node and manually kill the processes if necessary.
7. **The ""Failed to open the file"" Error**: Delete comments in the `config.json` file or re-run the `gaianet init` command.
8. **Too many open files** on macOS: Increase the default FD limit using the `ulimit -n` command.

Additionally, there are a few tips and fixes for other issues encountered during installation:

* Increase the default FD limit when running `gaianet init` and `gaianet start`.
* Use the `--tmpdir` option to specify where to install the WasmEdge runtime."

","Q: 2. What command is used to install CUDA into Python's environment?
A: The command used to install CUDA into Python's environment is:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install --upgrade fschat accelerate autoawq vllm
```

However, note that this installation may not necessarily include all the necessary libraries and dependencies for your specific use case. You may need to adjust this command or install additional packages depending on your requirements.

Additionally, make sure you have Python 3 installed and that pip is up to date before running this command.

**Bonus Tip:** Always use `sudo` with caution and only when necessary, as it grants elevated privileges to the current user. In this case, it's used to ensure that pip can install packages globally without any issues."

```
The error is caused by the lack of `libgomp.so.1`, a library that should be automatically installed on Ubuntu by default.

To solve this, you must install the `libgomp.so.1` library.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgomp1
```

If you're using CentOS, you can use

```
yum install libgomp
```

This issue was fixed in `version 0.2.2`.

## Failed to remove the default collection

```
Failed to remove the default collection. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: No such file or directory (os error 2)""},""time"":0.050924542}
```

It typically indicates that the Qdrant instance was not shut down properly before you try to init it again with a new snapshot. The solution is to stop the GaiaNet node first.

```
gaianet stop
```

Alternatively, you could mannually kill the processes from the terminal or in the OS's Actvity Monitor.

```
sudo pkill -9 qdrant
sudo pkill -9 wasmedge
sudo pkill -9 frpc
```

Then you can run `gaianet init` and then `gaianet start` again.

## File I/O error

```

The reason for this type of error is a mis-configured `config.json` file. The solution is to delete the comments in `config.json` and re-run the `gaianet init` command.

## The ""Too many open files"" Error on macOS

When running `gaianet init` to initialize a new node on macOS, you may encounter an error related to snapshot recovery if your snapshot contains a large amount of text. The error message may be the following:

```
 * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
```

This issue is caused by the default file descriptor (FD) limit on macOS, which is set to a relatively low value of 256.

To resolve this issue, you can increase the default FD limit on your system. To do so, run the following command:

```
ulimit -n 10000
```

This will temporarily set the FD limit to 10,000. Next, use `gaianet init` and `gaianet start` commands in the SAME terminal.

## Permission denied when use the installer script to install WasmEdge

When running `curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash` to install GaiaNet node software, you may meet the permisson denied error especially installing the WasmEdge runtime. 

![](troubleshooting-01.png)

This error is caused by the lack of `/tmp` write permission. You can use `--tmpdir` to specify where you want to install the WasmEdge runtime. Please note, you will need to have written permission to the `<YOUR_PATH>` folder.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s -- --tmpdir YOUR_PATH
```

This problem is fixed in `version 0.2.3`.



","Q: 3. How do you link non-standard CUDA libraries to the standard location to fix an issue where `libcu*12` cannot be found?
A: To link non-standard CUDA libraries to the standard location, you can use the `ln -s` command. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the non-standard location of the CUDA libraries. In this case, it's `/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/`.
2. Create a symbolic link to the standard location where the libraries should be located, which is `/usr/lib/`.

Here's an example:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/libcublas.so.12 /usr/lib/libcublas.so.12
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cuda_runtime/lib/libcudart.so.12 /usr/lib/libcudart.so.12
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/libcublasLt.so.12 /usr/lib/libcublasLt.so.12
```

This will create symbolic links to the CUDA libraries in the standard location, allowing them to be found by your system.

**Bonus Tip**: Make sure to replace `/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/` and `/usr/lib/` with the actual paths on your system where the CUDA libraries are installed.

**Example Use Case**: If you're using a Python environment, you can install the CUDA toolkit as part of your Python setup using pip:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install --upgrade fschat accelerate autoawq vllm
```

After installing the CUDA toolkit, you can link the non-standard CUDA libraries to the standard location as shown above."

# Troubleshooting

## The system cannot find CUDA libraries

Sometimes, the CUDA toolkit is installed in a non-standard location. The error message here is often not able to find `libcu*12`. For example, you might have CUDA installed with your Python setup. The following command would install CUDA into Python's enviornment.

```
sudo apt install python3-pip -y

```

The easiest way to fix is simply to link those non-standard CUDA libraries to the standard location, like this.

## Load library failed: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


On Windows WSL, you may see this error when running `curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash`

```

[2024-07-02 17:50:55.176] [error]   Load library failed: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
The error is caused by the lack of `libgomp.so.1`, a library that should be automatically installed on Ubuntu by default.

To solve this, you must install the `libgomp.so.1` library.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgomp1
```

If you're using CentOS, you can use

```
yum install libgomp
```

This issue was fixed in `version 0.2.2`.

## Failed to remove the default collection

```
Failed to remove the default collection. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: No such file or directory (os error 2)""},""time"":0.050924542}
```

It typically indicates that the Qdrant instance was not shut down properly before you try to init it again with a new snapshot. The solution is to stop the GaiaNet node first.

```
gaianet stop
```

Alternatively, you could mannually kill the processes from the terminal or in the OS's Actvity Monitor.

```
sudo pkill -9 qdrant
sudo pkill -9 wasmedge
sudo pkill -9 frpc
```

Then you can run `gaianet init` and then `gaianet start` again.

## File I/O error

```
    * Import the Qdrant collection snapshot ...

The reason for this type of error is a mis-configured `config.json` file. The solution is to delete the comments in `config.json` and re-run the `gaianet init` command.

## The ""Too many open files"" Error on macOS

When running `gaianet init` to initialize a new node on macOS, you may encounter an error related to snapshot recovery if your snapshot contains a large amount of text. The error message may be the following:

```
 * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
```

This issue is caused by the default file descriptor (FD) limit on macOS, which is set to a relatively low value of 256.

To resolve this issue, you can increase the default FD limit on your system. To do so, run the following command:

```
ulimit -n 10000
```

This will temporarily set the FD limit to 10,000. Next, use `gaianet init` and `gaianet start` commands in the SAME terminal.

## Permission denied when use the installer script to install WasmEdge

When running `curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash` to install GaiaNet node software, you may meet the permisson denied error especially installing the WasmEdge runtime. 

![](troubleshooting-01.png)

This error is caused by the lack of `/tmp` write permission. You can use `--tmpdir` to specify where you want to install the WasmEdge runtime. Please note, you will need to have written permission to the `<YOUR_PATH>` folder.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s -- --tmpdir YOUR_PATH
```

This problem is fixed in `version 0.2.3`.



","Q: 6. How can you disable the `autoMemoryReclaim` feature in WSL to resolve issues with memory reclaiming?
A: To disable the `autoMemoryReclaim` feature in WSL and resolve issues with memory reclaiming, you can follow these steps:

1.  Edit the file `C:\Users\<Your user name>\wslconfig` (replace `<Your user name>` with your actual username).
2.  Comment out or remove the line `[experimental] autoMemoryReclaim = true` in the configuration file.

Here's an example of how the edited configuration might look:

```bash
[automount]
root = /mnt/
options = metadata,umask=22,fmask=132

[distro]
default = Ubuntu-20.04

[interop]
enabled = true

[metadata]

[network]
generateHosts = true

[forwardedPorts]
<port1>:<host-port>
<port2>:<host-port>

[files]
# uncomment to use a non-standard directory for storing the WSL distro files
distro: C:\wsl-distros\
```

In this example, we've removed the `autoMemoryReclaim` feature by commenting out or removing its configuration line. This should resolve any memory reclaiming issues in your WSL setup.

Remember to restart WSL after making changes to its configuration file.

**Additional Tips**

*   The `C:\Users\<Your user name>\wslconfig` file can vary depending on the version of Windows and your specific WSL installation.
*   If you're running an older version of WSL, it might not have this feature. In that case, you won't need to disable it.
*   You can also try adjusting other settings in the `wslconfig` file to fine-tune your WSL setup.

**Bonus**

You can also use the following commands to disable auto memory reclaiming:

```bash
wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu-20.04 --unshare --set-auto-reboot OFF
```

Or

```bash
wsl --shutdown --auto-off ON
```
This command will shut down your WSL instance and set `autoMemoryReclaim` to false.

**Reference**

For more information on the `wslconfig` file, you can refer to [the official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

Please note that the configuration file format may change with new updates."

# Troubleshooting

## The system cannot find CUDA libraries

Sometimes, the CUDA toolkit is installed in a non-standard location. The error message here is often not able to find `libcu*12`. For example, you might have CUDA installed with your Python setup. The following command would install CUDA into Python's enviornment.

```
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install --upgrade fschat accelerate autoawq vllm
```

The easiest way to fix is simply to link those non-standard CUDA libraries to the standard location, like this.

```
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/libcublas.so.12 /usr/lib/libcublas.so.12

## Failed to recover from collection snapshot on Windows WSL

On Windows WSL, you could see this error while running `gaianet init`.

```
   * Import the Qdrant collection snapshot ...
      The process may take a few minutes. Please wait ...
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Tokio task join error: task 1242 panicked""},""time"":0.697784244}
```

When you look into the `~/gaianet/log/init-qdrant.log` file, you could see this line of error

```
2024-05-20T07:24:52.900895Z ERROR qdrant::startup: Panic occurred in file /home/runner/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/cgroups-rs-0.3.4/src/memory.rs at line 587: called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: ReadFailed(""/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.high""), cause: Some(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: ""No such file or directory"" }) }  
```

The solution is to disable the `autoMemoryReclaim` feature in WSL. Step to turn on/off this feature:

1. Edit `C:\Users<Your user name>.wslconfig`
2. Remove or comment out `autoMemoryReclaim` in `[experimental]` section.

## Failed to start the node with an error message `Port 8080 is in use. Exit ...`

You may see the following error when you run `gaianet start`. 

```
gaianet start
[+] Checking the config.json file ...

You already have a private key.
[+] Starting LlamaEdge API Server ...

    Port 8080 is in use. Exit ...
```

The solution is to run `gaianet stop`  first to kill all processes, and then run `gaianet start` to start the node.


## Load library failed: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


On Windows WSL, you may see this error when running `curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash`

```

[2024-07-02 17:50:55.176] [error]   Load library failed: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
The error is caused by the lack of `libgomp.so.1`, a library that should be automatically installed on Ubuntu by default.

To solve this, you must install the `libgomp.so.1` library.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgomp1
```

If you're using CentOS, you can use

```
yum install libgomp
```

This issue was fixed in `version 0.2.2`.

## Failed to remove the default collection

```
Failed to remove the default collection. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: No such file or directory (os error 2)""},""time"":0.050924542}
```

It typically indicates that the Qdrant instance was not shut down properly before you try to init it again with a new snapshot. The solution is to stop the GaiaNet node first.

```
gaianet stop
```

Alternatively, you could mannually kill the processes from the terminal or in the OS's Actvity Monitor.

```
sudo pkill -9 qdrant
sudo pkill -9 wasmedge
sudo pkill -9 frpc
```

Then you can run `gaianet init` and then `gaianet start` again.

## File I/O error

```
    * Import the Qdrant collection snapshot ...
      The process may take a few minutes. Please wait ...
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. An error occurred processing field `snapshot`: File I/O error: Operation not permitted (os error 1) 
```

It typically indicates that the Qdrant instance was not shut down properly before you try to init it again with a new snapshot. The solution is to stop the GaiaNet node first. 

```
gaianet stop
```

Alternatively, you could mannually kill the processes from the terminal or in the OS's Actvity Monitor.

```
sudo pkill -9 qdrant
sudo pkill -9 wasmedge
sudo pkill -9 frpc
```

Then you can run `gaianet init` and then `gaianet start` again.

## The ""Failed to open the file"" Error

```
Warning: Failed to open the file 
Warning: https://huggingface.co/datasets/max-id/gaianet-qdrant-snapshot/resolve
Warning: /main/consensus/consensus.snapshot: No such file or directory
curl: (23) Failure writing output to destination
```

The reason for this type of error is a mis-configured `config.json` file. The solution is to delete the comments in `config.json` and re-run the `gaianet init` command.

## The ""Too many open files"" Error on macOS

When running `gaianet init` to initialize a new node on macOS, you may encounter an error related to snapshot recovery if your snapshot contains a large amount of text. The error message may be the following:

```
 * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
    * [Error] Failed to recover from the collection snapshot. {""status"":{""error"":""Service internal error: Too many open files (os error 24)""},""time"":1.574064833}
```

This issue is caused by the default file descriptor (FD) limit on macOS, which is set to a relatively low value of 256.

To resolve this issue, you can increase the default FD limit on your system. To do so, run the following command:

```
ulimit -n 10000
```

This will temporarily set the FD limit to 10,000. Next, use `gaianet init` and `gaianet start` commands in the SAME terminal.

## Permission denied when use the installer script to install WasmEdge

When running `curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash` to install GaiaNet node software, you may meet the permisson denied error especially installing the WasmEdge runtime. 

![](troubleshooting-01.png)

This error is caused by the lack of `/tmp` write permission. You can use `--tmpdir` to specify where you want to install the WasmEdge runtime. Please note, you will need to have written permission to the `<YOUR_PATH>` folder.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s -- --tmpdir YOUR_PATH
```

This problem is fixed in `version 0.2.3`.

# Troubleshooting

## The system cannot find CUDA libraries

Sometimes, the CUDA toolkit is installed in a non-standard location. The error message here is often not able to find `libcu*12`. For example, you might have CUDA installed with your Python setup. The following command would install CUDA into Python's enviornment.

```
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install --upgrade fschat accelerate autoawq vllm
```

The easiest way to fix is simply to link those non-standard CUDA libraries to the standard location, like this.

```
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/libcublas.so.12 /usr/lib/libcublas.so.12
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/nvidia/cuda_runtime/lib/libcudart.so.12 /usr/lib/libcudart.so.12

# Calling external tools

Tool calling is one of the truly ""LLM native"" interaction modes that has never existed before. 
It gives the ""thinking"" LLMs the ability to ""act"" -- both in acquiring new knowledge and in performing real world actions. It is a crucial part of any agentic application.

Open source LLMs are increasingly good at using tools. The Llama 3 models have now made it possible to have reliable tool calling performance on 8b class of LLMs running on your own laptop!

In this tutorial, we will show you a simple Python program that allows a local LLM to run code and manipulate data on the local computer!


## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../node-guide/quick-start.md). You will need to start a Gaia node for the [Llama-3-Groq model](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-groq-8b-tool) or the [Mistral-7B-v0.3 Instruct model](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/mistral-0.3-7b-instruct-tool-call) . You can then use the node's API URL endpoint and model name in your tool call apps.
* [use a public node](../user-guide/nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public Llama3 node with the function call support.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |
| API KEY | gaia |


## Run the demo agent

The [agent app](https://github.com/second-state/llm_todo) is written in Python. It demonstrates how the LLM could use tools to operate a SQL database. In this case, it starts and operates an in-memory SQLite database. The database stores a list of todo items. 

Download the code and install the Python dependencies as follows. 

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llm_todo
cd llm_todo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the environment variables for the API server and model name we just set up. 

```
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=""llama""
export OPENAI_BASE_URL= ""https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1""
```

Run the `main.py` application and bring up the command line chat interface. 

```
python main.py
```

## Use the agent

Now, you can ask the LLM to perform tasks. For example, you can say 

```
User: 
Help me to write down it I'm going to have a meeting with the marketing team.
```

The LLM understands that you need to insert a record into the database and returns a tool call response in JSON. 

```
Assistant:
<tool_call>
{""id"": 0, ""name"": ""create_task"", ""arguments"": {""task"": ""have a meeting with the marketing team""}}
</tool_call>
```

The agent app (i.e., `main.py`) executes the tool call `create_task` in the JSON response, and sends back the results as role `Tool`. You do not need to do anything here as it happens automatically in `main.py`. The SQLite database is updated when the agent app executes the tool call. 

```
Tool:
[{'result': 'ok'}]
```

The LLM receives the execution result and then answers you. 

```
Assistant:
I've added ""have a meeting with the marketing team"" to your task list. Is there anything else you'd like to do?
```

You can continue the conversation. 

To learn more about how tool calling works, see [this article](https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge/blob/main/api-server/ToolUse.md).


## Make it robust 

One of the major challenges for LLM applications is the frequent unreliability of their responses. For example:

*If the LLM generates an incorrect tool call that fails to address the user’s query,*

you can refine and optimize the descriptions for each tool call function. The LLM chooses its tools based on these descriptions, so it's vital to craft them in a way that aligns with typical user queries.

If the LLM hallucinates and produces tool calls with non-existent function names or incorrect parameters,

*the agent app should identify this issue and prompt the LLM to create a new response.*

Tool calling is a fundamental feature in the evolving field of agentic LLM applications. We’re eager to see the innovative ideas you bring forward!


","Summary:
This text appears to be a tutorial on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools, specifically SQL databases. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Prerequisites**

* The user needs access to a Gaia node, either by running their own or using a public one.
* The user needs to have an LLM model configured on the Gaia node, such as Llama 3-Groq or Mistral 7B-v0.3 Instruct.

**Running the Demo Agent**

* The user is provided with a Python script (agent app) that demonstrates how the LLM can use tools to operate a SQL database.
* The agent app uses the Gaia node's API endpoint and model name to make tool calls.
* The user needs to download the code, install dependencies, set environment variables, and run the `main.py` application.

**Using the Agent**

* The user interacts with the LLM through a command-line chat interface.
* The LLM uses tools to perform tasks, such as inserting records into a SQLite database.
* The agent app executes tool calls in response to user queries and sends back results as ""Tool"" roles.

**Making it Robust**

* The tutorial highlights challenges of unreliability in LLM responses, such as incorrect tool call generation or hallucination.
* To address these issues, the user is encouraged to refine and optimize tool call descriptions and implement error handling in the agent app to prompt the LLM for a new response.

Overall, this tutorial aims to provide a basic understanding of how LLMs can interact with external tools using Gaia nodes and Python scripts."

# Calling external tools

Tool calling is one of the truly ""LLM native"" interaction modes that has never existed before. 
It gives the ""thinking"" LLMs the ability to ""act"" -- both in acquiring new knowledge and in performing real world actions. It is a crucial part of any agentic application.

Open source LLMs are increasingly good at using tools. The Llama 3 models have now made it possible to have reliable tool calling performance on 8b class of LLMs running on your own laptop!

In this tutorial, we will show you a simple Python program that allows a local LLM to run code and manipulate data on the local computer!


## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../node-guide/quick-start.md). You will need to start a Gaia node for the [Llama-3-Groq model](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-groq-8b-tool) or the [Mistral-7B-v0.3 Instruct model](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/mistral-0.3-7b-instruct-tool-call) . You can then use the node's API URL endpoint and model name in your tool call apps.
* [use a public node](../user-guide/nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public Llama3 node with the function call support.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |
| API KEY | gaia |


## Run the demo agent

The [agent app](https://github.com/second-state/llm_todo) is written in Python. It demonstrates how the LLM could use tools to operate a SQL database. In this case, it starts and operates an in-memory SQLite database. The database stores a list of todo items. 

Download the code and install the Python dependencies as follows. 

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llm_todo
cd llm_todo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the environment variables for the API server and model name we just set up. 

```
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=""llama""
export OPENAI_BASE_URL= ""https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1""
```

Run the `main.py` application and bring up the command line chat interface. 

```
python main.py
```

## Use the agent

Now, you can ask the LLM to perform tasks. For example, you can say 

```
User: 
Help me to write down it I'm going to have a meeting with the marketing team.
```

The LLM understands that you need to insert a record into the database and returns a tool call response in JSON. 

```
Assistant:
<tool_call>
{""id"": 0, ""name"": ""create_task"", ""arguments"": {""task"": ""have a meeting with the marketing team""}}
</tool_call>
```

The agent app (i.e., `main.py`) executes the tool call `create_task` in the JSON response, and sends back the results as role `Tool`. You do not need to do anything here as it happens automatically in `main.py`. The SQLite database is updated when the agent app executes the tool call. 

```
Tool:
[{'result': 'ok'}]
```

The LLM receives the execution result and then answers you. 

```
Assistant:
I've added ""have a meeting with the marketing team"" to your task list. Is there anything else you'd like to do?
```

You can continue the conversation. 

To learn more about how tool calling works, see [this article](https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge/blob/main/api-server/ToolUse.md).


## Make it robust 

One of the major challenges for LLM applications is the frequent unreliability of their responses. For example:

*If the LLM generates an incorrect tool call that fails to address the user’s query,*

you can refine and optimize the descriptions for each tool call function. The LLM chooses its tools based on these descriptions, so it's vital to craft them in a way that aligns with typical user queries.

If the LLM hallucinates and produces tool calls with non-existent function names or incorrect parameters,

*the agent app should identify this issue and prompt the LLM to create a new response.*

Tool calling is a fundamental feature in the evolving field of agentic LLM applications. We’re eager to see the innovative ideas you bring forward!


","Q: What are the prerequisites for using a Gaia node to provide LLM services through a public URL?
A: To use a Gaia node to provide LLM services through a public URL, the following prerequisites need to be met:

1.  **Run your own Gaia node**: You can run your own Gaia node and start it for the `Llama-3-Groq model` or the `Mistral-7B-v0.3 Instruct model`. After setting up the node, you can then use its API URL endpoint and model name in your tool call applications.
2.  **Use a public node**: Alternatively, you can use a pre-existing public Gaia node to provide LLM services through their publicly accessible API.

Additionally, when using a public node or running your own, you'll need to have the following:

*   **API endpoint URL**: You'll require the URL of the Gaia node's API endpoint.
*   **Model Name**: The name of the LLM model being used (e.g., `llama`).
*   **API KEY**: A valid API key for accessing the Gaia node."

","Q: Can you run your own Gaia node and use it to provide LLM services through a public URL?
A: Running your own Gaia node and using it to provide LLM services through a public URL is technically possible, but it requires significant resources and expertise. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

**Prerequisites**

1. **Hardware**: You'll need a powerful machine with:
	* At least 128 GB of RAM
	* A high-performance CPU (e.g., AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon)
	* A large SSD storage (e.g., 2 TB) for the node's operating system and data
2. **Software**: Familiarity with Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu or CentOS
3. **Networking**: A stable internet connection with a high-speed bandwidth (at least 1 Gbps)

**Step 1: Set up your Gaia node**

1. Download and install the Gaia node software from the official GitHub repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the README file to configure your node.
3. Initialize the node's database by running `gaiad init` and completing the setup wizard.

**Step 2: Configure your LLM model**

1. Choose an LLM model you'd like to run on your node (e.g., Llama-3-Groq or Mistral-7B-v0.3 Instruct).
2. Download the pre-trained model weights and follow the instructions in the README file to configure your model.

**Step 3: Set up the public URL**

1. Configure a reverse proxy server (e.g., NGINX) to route incoming requests from the internet to your Gaia node.
2. Set up SSL/TLS encryption using a certificate from a trusted authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
3. Update your node's API endpoint URL to include the public domain name and port number.

**Step 4: Test and optimize**

1. Verify that your Gaia node is reachable and responding correctly.
2. Test your LLM model by sending requests through the public URL.
3. Optimize your node's performance by adjusting settings, such as memory allocation, CPU affinity, and network configuration.

**Additional considerations**

* Ensure you comply with any applicable laws, regulations, or terms of service related to hosting a public LLM service.
* Consider implementing security measures, such as rate limiting, IP blocking, or access controls.
* Monitor your node's performance and adjust settings as needed to maintain optimal responsiveness and resource utilization.

Running a Gaia node is a complex task that requires significant resources and expertise. If you're not familiar with the technology or don't have the necessary hardware, it may be more feasible to use a public Gaia node instead."

","Q: Do you need to start a Gaia node for the specific model to be able to call tools successfully?
A: According to the provided tutorial, it seems that running a Gaia node with a specific model is one of two options (the other being using a public node) to enable tool calling functionality.

The tutorial mentions starting a Gaia node for either the `Llama-3-Groq` or the `Mistral-7B-v0.3 Instruct` models, and then using that node's API URL endpoint and model name in your tool call apps.

However, if you have access to a public LLM node that supports function calls (in this case, the `llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1` node), you can also use it as an alternative to setting up your own Gaia node.

Therefore, it's not strictly necessary to start a Gaia node for every specific model. But if you want to run a custom node with a specific configuration (e.g., for performance or security reasons), starting a Gaia node might be the better option for you.

**Bonus tip**: Make sure to check the documentation of your chosen LLM model and tool calling framework to confirm their specific requirements and recommendations for setting up and running a Gaia node.

Example outside of the content: Suppose you're building an LLM-powered chatbot that needs to interact with external APIs. You might want to set up a custom Gaia node with specific models and configurations tailored to your bot's requirements, even if it means investing time in managing the node infrastructure.

Remember that tool calling is just one aspect of agentic LLM applications, and you'll need to consider various factors when choosing between using public nodes or running your own customized setup."

","Q: How do you set the environment variables for the API server and model name when using the Llama3 model with tool call support?
A: To set the environment variables for the API server and model name when using the Llama3 model with tool call support, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Export the OPENAI_BASE_URL variable**: This is the URL of your Gaia node that provides access to the Llama3 model with tool call support. In this case, it's `https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1`.

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1""
```

2. **Export the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME variable**: This is the name of the model you want to use for tool call support. In this case, it's `llama`.

```bash
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=""llama""
```

Note that these environment variables should be set before running your Python script or agent app.

Alternatively, you can also store these values in a configuration file (e.g., `.env`) and load them using a library like `python-dotenv` or `dotenv`. This approach keeps your sensitive information separate from your code.

```bash
# .env file content
OPENAI_BASE_URL=""https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1""
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=""llama""

# In your Python script, load the environment variables like this:
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

openai_base_url = os.getenv(""OPENAI_BASE_URL"")
openai_model_name = os.getenv(""OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"")

print(f""OPENAI_BASE_URL: {openai_base_url}"")
print(f""OPENAI_MODEL_NAME: {openai_model_name}"")
```

By setting these environment variables, you'll ensure that your Python script or agent app can communicate with the Llama3 model and tool call support via the Gaia node."

The [agent app](https://github.com/second-state/llm_todo) is written in Python. It demonstrates how the LLM could use tools to operate a SQL database. In this case, it starts and operates an in-memory SQLite database. The database stores a list of todo items. 

Download the code and install the Python dependencies as follows. 

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llm_todo
cd llm_todo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the environment variables for the API server and model name we just set up. 

```
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=""llama""
export OPENAI_BASE_URL= ""https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1""
```

Run the `main.py` application and bring up the command line chat interface. 

```
python main.py
```

## Use the agent

Now, you can ask the LLM to perform tasks. For example, you can say 

```
User: 
Help me to write down it I'm going to have a meeting with the marketing team.
```

The LLM understands that you need to insert a record into the database and returns a tool call response in JSON. 

```
Assistant:
<tool_call>
{""id"": 0, ""name"": ""create_task"", ""arguments"": {""task"": ""have a meeting with the marketing team""}}
</tool_call>
```

The agent app (i.e., `main.py`) executes the tool call `create_task` in the JSON response, and sends back the results as role `Tool`. You do not need to do anything here as it happens automatically in `main.py`. The SQLite database is updated when the agent app executes the tool call. 

```
Tool:
[{'result': 'ok'}]
```

The LLM receives the execution result and then answers you. 

```
Assistant:
I've added ""have a meeting with the marketing team"" to your task list. Is there anything else you'd like to do?
```

You can continue the conversation.

## Make it robust 

One of the major challenges for LLM applications is the frequent unreliability of their responses. For example:

*If the LLM generates an incorrect tool call that fails to address the user’s query,*

you can refine and optimize the descriptions for each tool call function. The LLM chooses its tools based on these descriptions, so it's vital to craft them in a way that aligns with typical user queries.

If the LLM hallucinates and produces tool calls with non-existent function names or incorrect parameters,

*the agent app should identify this issue and prompt the LLM to create a new response.*

Tool calling is a fundamental feature in the evolving field of agentic LLM applications. We’re eager to see the innovative ideas you bring forward!


","Q: In what format does the LLM return a tool call response in JSON after executing a command?
A: The LLM returns a tool call response in JSON with the following format after executing a command:

```json
{
  ""id"": <integer>,
  ""name"": ""<string>"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""<argument_name>"": ""<value>""
  }
}
```

However, as mentioned in the tutorial, when the LLM returns this tool call response in JSON, the `main.py` application (the agent app) executes the tool call and sends back the results as role `Tool`. The JSON response from the LLM would look something like this:

```json
{
  ""tool_call"": {
    ""<tool_name>"": {
      ""arguments"": {
        ""<argument_name>"": ""<value>""
      },
      ""result"": ""<string>"" // or a list of results
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example:

```
{
  ""tool_call"": {
    ""create_task"": {
      ""arguments"": {
        ""task"": ""have a meeting with the marketing team""
      },
      ""result"": ""ok""
    }
  }
}
```"

# Calling external tools

Tool calling is one of the truly ""LLM native"" interaction modes that has never existed before. 
It gives the ""thinking"" LLMs the ability to ""act"" -- both in acquiring new knowledge and in performing real world actions. It is a crucial part of any agentic application.

Open source LLMs are increasingly good at using tools. The Llama 3 models have now made it possible to have reliable tool calling performance on 8b class of LLMs running on your own laptop!

In this tutorial, we will show you a simple Python program that allows a local LLM to run code and manipulate data on the local computer!


## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../node-guide/quick-start.md). You will need to start a Gaia node for the [Llama-3-Groq model](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-groq-8b-tool) or the [Mistral-7B-v0.3 Instruct model](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/mistral-0.3-7b-instruct-tool-call) . You can then use the node's API URL endpoint and model name in your tool call apps.
* [use a public node](../user-guide/nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public Llama3 node with the function call support.

Tool calling is a fundamental feature in the evolving field of agentic LLM applications. We’re eager to see the innovative ideas you bring forward!


","Q: What happens automatically in main.py that does not require further action from the user? 
A: In the `main.py` application, several actions are performed automatically without requiring further action from the user. Some of these actions include:

1.  **Execution of tool calls**: When the LLM receives a tool call response in JSON, it is executed automatically by the agent app (`main.py`). This means that the database operations specified in the tool call (such as inserting or retrieving data) are performed without requiring manual intervention.

2.  **Database updates**: The SQLite database is updated automatically when the agent app executes the tool calls. For example, if a tool call specifies creating a new task, the corresponding record will be inserted into the database.

3.  **Response generation**: After executing the tool calls and updating the database, the LLM generates a response based on the outcome of these operations. This response is then returned to the user without requiring further action from them.

To illustrate this process, let's consider an example:

Suppose the user asks the LLM to create a new task with the description ""have a meeting with the marketing team"". The LLM generates a tool call response in JSON and sends it to `main.py`. This tool call includes the necessary arguments for creating a new task.

The `main.py` application executes this tool call, inserts the corresponding record into the SQLite database, and then generates a response indicating that the task has been added. Finally, the LLM returns this response to the user without requiring further action from them.

These automatic actions in `main.py` allow the agent app to perform complex tasks efficiently and effectively, making it a robust tool for managing databases and generating responses based on user queries."

# Agentic translation on GaiaNet

Prof. Andrew Ng's [agentic translation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_github-andrewyngtranslation-agent-activity-7206347897938866176-5tDJ/) is a great demonstration on how to cooridnate multiple LLM ""agents"" to work on a single task. It allows multiple smaller LLMs (like Llama-3 or Gemma-2) to work gether and produce better results than a single large LLM (like ChatGPT).

[GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/), with 2000+ nodes running all kinds of finetuned LLms and knowledge bases, provides a huge opportunity for agentic apps to choose and use their own LLM backends.

## Introduction to the LLM Translation Agent

This LLM Translation Agent is designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use your own fine-tuned models or any LLMs on Hugging Face like Meta's Llama 3. 

> For detailed commands on starting and running this agent, please visit [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).

To get started, clone the Translation Agent.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Next, we will install a local GaiaNet node, which provides the backend API services required by the agent. You can, of course, use [GaiaNet nodes from the community](https://docs.gaianet.ai/user-guide/nodes) if you do not want to start your own.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
```

You will also need the following configurations and prerequisites to run the agent app. If you are using a public GaiaNet node instead of your local node, replace the `http://localhost:8080` with `https://node_id.us.gaianet.network`.

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""http://localhost:8080/v1""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Demo 1: Running Translation Agents with Llama-3-8B

First, let's run the translation agent with Meta AI's popular Llama-3 model. We select the smallest Llama-3 model (the 8b model) for this demo. The translation task is from Chinese to English. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City.

### Step 1.1: Run a Llama-3-8B GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 5.73 GB. It can take a while to download.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 1.2 Run the Translation Agent on top of Llama-3-8B

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 
  
```
import os
import translation_agent as ta
        
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.
   
```bash
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

Wait for several minutes and you will have [a fully translated version](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-Llama-3-8B) appear on your terminal screen.

## Demo 2: Running Translation Agents with gemma-2-27b

The benefit of running the Translation Agent with GaiaNet is the ability for users to choose and embed different LLMs for different agentic tasks. To demonstrate this point, we will now change the translation agent LLM from Llama-3-8b to Google's gemma-2-27b, which is of similar size but scores higher on many language-related benchmarks.

The translation task is the same as before. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City. The translation target is English.

### Step 2.1 Run a gemma-2-27b GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 6.40G, it could take a while to download.

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/gemma-2-27b-it/config.json
```    

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```
    
### Step 2.2 Run the Translation Agent to run on top of gemma-2-27b

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here,because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.

```
cd examples    
python example_script.py
```
    
You can find the translated result in English [here](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-gemma-2-27b).

## Demo 3: Running Translation Agents with Phi-3-Medium long context model

The Llama-3 and Gemma-2 models are great LLMs, but they have relatively small context windows. The agent requires all text to fit into the LLM context window, and that limits the size of articles they can translate. To fix this problem, we could select an open source LLM with a large context window. For this demo, we choose Microsoft's Phi-3-medium-128k model, which has a massive 128k (over 100 thousand words or the length of several books) context window.

We run [a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with the Varsaille Palace](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) through our Translation Agent powered by a Phi-3-medium-128k model we start locally.

### Step 3.1: Run a Phi-3-medium-128k GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. 

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/phi-3-medium-instruct-128k/config_full.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node with a 128k context window.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 3.2 Clone and run the Translation Agent on top of Phi-3-medium-128k

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts. 

## Conclusion

[GaiaNet](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI) provides an easy way to select and use different open-source LLMs in your agentic applications to fully take advantage of their finetuned capabilities for specific tasks.

Once you have a local GaiaNet node up and running, you could share it with others and make $$$ by joining the [GaiaNet network](https://www.gaianet.ai/)!
","Summary:
**Agentic Translation on GaiaNet: A Comprehensive Summary**

GaiaNet is a platform that allows users to coordinate multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) ""agents"" to work together on a single task, demonstrating Andrew Ng's agentic translation concept. This summary provides an overview of the process and evaluates the performance of three LLMs: Meta AI's Llama-3, Google's Gemma-2, and Microsoft's Phi-3.

**Translation Agent Examples**

The following examples demonstrate how to run the Translation Agent with different LLMs:

1. **Llama-3-8B**: This example uses the smallest Llama-3 model, translating a short intro article from Chinese to English.
2. **Gemma-2-27b**: This example translates a brief intro to Forbidden City using Gemma-2, which provides high-quality translations with linguistic finesse.
3. **Phi-3-medium-128k**: This example uses the Phi-3 model with a large context window (128k) to translate a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with Versailles Palace.

**Evaluation of Translation Quality**

Each LLM has its strengths and weaknesses:

1. **Llama-3-8B**: Provides accurate translations but exhibits stiffness in language, possibly indicating direct translation.
2. **Gemma-2-27b**: Offers smooth and natural English flow, suitable for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.
3. **Phi-3-medium-128k**: Can translate book-length text from Chinese to English with consistent quality, despite increased text length.

**Conclusion**

GaiaNet provides a platform for users to select and use different open-source LLMs in their agentic applications. By joining the GaiaNet network, users can share their local node and earn money."

# Agentic translation on GaiaNet

Prof. Andrew Ng's [agentic translation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_github-andrewyngtranslation-agent-activity-7206347897938866176-5tDJ/) is a great demonstration on how to cooridnate multiple LLM ""agents"" to work on a single task. It allows multiple smaller LLMs (like Llama-3 or Gemma-2) to work gether and produce better results than a single large LLM (like ChatGPT).

[GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/), with 2000+ nodes running all kinds of finetuned LLms and knowledge bases, provides a huge opportunity for agentic apps to choose and use their own LLM backends.

## Introduction to the LLM Translation Agent

This LLM Translation Agent is designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use your own fine-tuned models or any LLMs on Hugging Face like Meta's Llama 3. 

> For detailed commands on starting and running this agent, please visit [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).

To get started, clone the Translation Agent.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Next, we will install a local GaiaNet node, which provides the backend API services required by the agent. You can, of course, use [GaiaNet nodes from the community](https://docs.gaianet.ai/user-guide/nodes) if you do not want to start your own.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
```

You will also need the following configurations and prerequisites to run the agent app. If you are using a public GaiaNet node instead of your local node, replace the `http://localhost:8080` with `https://node_id.us.gaianet.network`.

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""http://localhost:8080/v1""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Demo 1: Running Translation Agents with Llama-3-8B

First, let's run the translation agent with Meta AI's popular Llama-3 model. We select the smallest Llama-3 model (the 8b model) for this demo. The translation task is from Chinese to English. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City.

### Step 1.1: Run a Llama-3-8B GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 5.73 GB. It can take a while to download.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 1.2 Run the Translation Agent on top of Llama-3-8B

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 
  
```
import os
import translation_agent as ta
        
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.
   
```bash
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

Wait for several minutes and you will have [a fully translated version](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-Llama-3-8B) appear on your terminal screen.

## Demo 2: Running Translation Agents with gemma-2-27b

The benefit of running the Translation Agent with GaiaNet is the ability for users to choose and embed different LLMs for different agentic tasks. To demonstrate this point, we will now change the translation agent LLM from Llama-3-8b to Google's gemma-2-27b, which is of similar size but scores higher on many language-related benchmarks.

The translation task is the same as before. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City. The translation target is English.

### Step 2.1 Run a gemma-2-27b GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 6.40G, it could take a while to download.

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/gemma-2-27b-it/config.json
```    

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```
    
### Step 2.2 Run the Translation Agent to run on top of gemma-2-27b

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here,because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.

```
cd examples    
python example_script.py
```
    
You can find the translated result in English [here](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-gemma-2-27b).

## Demo 3: Running Translation Agents with Phi-3-Medium long context model

The Llama-3 and Gemma-2 models are great LLMs, but they have relatively small context windows. The agent requires all text to fit into the LLM context window, and that limits the size of articles they can translate. To fix this problem, we could select an open source LLM with a large context window. For this demo, we choose Microsoft's Phi-3-medium-128k model, which has a massive 128k (over 100 thousand words or the length of several books) context window.

We run [a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with the Varsaille Palace](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) through our Translation Agent powered by a Phi-3-medium-128k model we start locally.

### Step 3.1: Run a Phi-3-medium-128k GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. 

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/phi-3-medium-instruct-128k/config_full.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node with a 128k context window.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 3.2 Clone and run the Translation Agent on top of Phi-3-medium-128k

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts. 

## Conclusion

[GaiaNet](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI) provides an easy way to select and use different open-source LLMs in your agentic applications to fully take advantage of their finetuned capabilities for specific tasks.

Once you have a local GaiaNet node up and running, you could share it with others and make $$$ by joining the [GaiaNet network](https://www.gaianet.ai/)!
","Q: 1. What is agentic translation?
A: Agentic translation is a technique developed by Prof. Andrew Ng that enables multiple smaller Language Models (LLMs) to work together to produce better translations than a single large LLM. This approach utilizes the strengths of individual models and combines their abilities to create a more accurate, efficient, and robust translation system.

In traditional machine translation, a single large model is responsible for translating text from one language to another. However, as the complexity of the translation task increases, these models can struggle to provide accurate results.

Agentic translation addresses this issue by dividing the translation process into smaller sub-tasks that can be handled by multiple smaller models, each specializing in different aspects of the translation. This approach has several benefits, including:

1.  **Improved accuracy**: By leveraging the strengths of individual models, agentic translation can produce more accurate translations than a single large model.
2.  **Increased efficiency**: Agentic translation can handle complex translation tasks more efficiently by dividing the workload among multiple models.
3.  **Robustness**: The combination of multiple models can provide robust results even when one or more models fail to perform well.

Agentic translation is particularly useful for complex translation tasks, such as translating lengthy documents, idiomatic expressions, or culturally specific content. By leveraging the strengths of individual models, agentic translation can produce high-quality translations that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with a single large model."

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts.

# Agentic translation on GaiaNet

Prof. Andrew Ng's [agentic translation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_github-andrewyngtranslation-agent-activity-7206347897938866176-5tDJ/) is a great demonstration on how to cooridnate multiple LLM ""agents"" to work on a single task. It allows multiple smaller LLMs (like Llama-3 or Gemma-2) to work gether and produce better results than a single large LLM (like ChatGPT).

[GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/), with 2000+ nodes running all kinds of finetuned LLms and knowledge bases, provides a huge opportunity for agentic apps to choose and use their own LLM backends.

## Introduction to the LLM Translation Agent

This LLM Translation Agent is designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use your own fine-tuned models or any LLMs on Hugging Face like Meta's Llama 3. 

> For detailed commands on starting and running this agent, please visit [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).

To get started, clone the Translation Agent.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Next, we will install a local GaiaNet node, which provides the backend API services required by the agent. You can, of course, use [GaiaNet nodes from the community](https://docs.gaianet.ai/user-guide/nodes) if you do not want to start your own.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
```

You will also need the following configurations and prerequisites to run the agent app. If you are using a public GaiaNet node instead of your local node, replace the `http://localhost:8080` with `https://node_id.us.gaianet.network`.

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""http://localhost:8080/v1""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Demo 1: Running Translation Agents with Llama-3-8B

First, let's run the translation agent with Meta AI's popular Llama-3 model. We select the smallest Llama-3 model (the 8b model) for this demo. The translation task is from Chinese to English. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City.

### Step 1.1: Run a Llama-3-8B GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 5.73 GB. It can take a while to download.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 1.2 Run the Translation Agent on top of Llama-3-8B

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 
  
```
import os
import translation_agent as ta
        
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.
   
```bash
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

Wait for several minutes and you will have [a fully translated version](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-Llama-3-8B) appear on your terminal screen.

## Demo 2: Running Translation Agents with gemma-2-27b

The benefit of running the Translation Agent with GaiaNet is the ability for users to choose and embed different LLMs for different agentic tasks. To demonstrate this point, we will now change the translation agent LLM from Llama-3-8b to Google's gemma-2-27b, which is of similar size but scores higher on many language-related benchmarks.

The translation task is the same as before. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City. The translation target is English.

### Step 2.1 Run a gemma-2-27b GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 6.40G, it could take a while to download.

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/gemma-2-27b-it/config.json
```    

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```
    
### Step 2.2 Run the Translation Agent to run on top of gemma-2-27b

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here,because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.

```
cd examples    
python example_script.py
```
    
You can find the translated result in English [here](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-gemma-2-27b).

## Demo 3: Running Translation Agents with Phi-3-Medium long context model

The Llama-3 and Gemma-2 models are great LLMs, but they have relatively small context windows. The agent requires all text to fit into the LLM context window, and that limits the size of articles they can translate. To fix this problem, we could select an open source LLM with a large context window. For this demo, we choose Microsoft's Phi-3-medium-128k model, which has a massive 128k (over 100 thousand words or the length of several books) context window.

We run [a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with the Varsaille Palace](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) through our Translation Agent powered by a Phi-3-medium-128k model we start locally.

### Step 3.1: Run a Phi-3-medium-128k GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. 

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/phi-3-medium-instruct-128k/config_full.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node with a 128k context window.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 3.2 Clone and run the Translation Agent on top of Phi-3-medium-128k

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts.

            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts.

# Agentic translation on GaiaNet

Prof. Andrew Ng's [agentic translation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_github-andrewyngtranslation-agent-activity-7206347897938866176-5tDJ/) is a great demonstration on how to cooridnate multiple LLM ""agents"" to work on a single task. It allows multiple smaller LLMs (like Llama-3 or Gemma-2) to work gether and produce better results than a single large LLM (like ChatGPT).

[GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/), with 2000+ nodes running all kinds of finetuned LLms and knowledge bases, provides a huge opportunity for agentic apps to choose and use their own LLM backends.

## Introduction to the LLM Translation Agent

This LLM Translation Agent is designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use your own fine-tuned models or any LLMs on Hugging Face like Meta's Llama 3. 

> For detailed commands on starting and running this agent, please visit [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).

To get started, clone the Translation Agent.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Next, we will install a local GaiaNet node, which provides the backend API services required by the agent. You can, of course, use [GaiaNet nodes from the community](https://docs.gaianet.ai/user-guide/nodes) if you do not want to start your own.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
```

You will also need the following configurations and prerequisites to run the agent app. If you are using a public GaiaNet node instead of your local node, replace the `http://localhost:8080` with `https://node_id.us.gaianet.network`.

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""http://localhost:8080/v1""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Demo 1: Running Translation Agents with Llama-3-8B

First, let's run the translation agent with Meta AI's popular Llama-3 model. We select the smallest Llama-3 model (the 8b model) for this demo. The translation task is from Chinese to English. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City.

### Step 1.1: Run a Llama-3-8B GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 5.73 GB. It can take a while to download.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 1.2 Run the Translation Agent on top of Llama-3-8B

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 
  
```
import os
import translation_agent as ta
        
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.
   
```bash
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

Wait for several minutes and you will have [a fully translated version](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-Llama-3-8B) appear on your terminal screen.

## Demo 2: Running Translation Agents with gemma-2-27b

The benefit of running the Translation Agent with GaiaNet is the ability for users to choose and embed different LLMs for different agentic tasks. To demonstrate this point, we will now change the translation agent LLM from Llama-3-8b to Google's gemma-2-27b, which is of similar size but scores higher on many language-related benchmarks.

The translation task is the same as before. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City. The translation target is English.

### Step 2.1 Run a gemma-2-27b GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 6.40G, it could take a while to download.

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/gemma-2-27b-it/config.json
```    

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```
    
### Step 2.2 Run the Translation Agent to run on top of gemma-2-27b

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here,because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.

```
cd examples    
python example_script.py
```
    
You can find the translated result in English [here](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-gemma-2-27b).

## Demo 3: Running Translation Agents with Phi-3-Medium long context model

The Llama-3 and Gemma-2 models are great LLMs, but they have relatively small context windows. The agent requires all text to fit into the LLM context window, and that limits the size of articles they can translate. To fix this problem, we could select an open source LLM with a large context window. For this demo, we choose Microsoft's Phi-3-medium-128k model, which has a massive 128k (over 100 thousand words or the length of several books) context window.

We run [a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with the Varsaille Palace](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) through our Translation Agent powered by a Phi-3-medium-128k model we start locally.

### Step 3.1: Run a Phi-3-medium-128k GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. 

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/phi-3-medium-instruct-128k/config_full.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node with a 128k context window.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 3.2 Clone and run the Translation Agent on top of Phi-3-medium-128k

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,

    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts. 

## Conclusion

[GaiaNet](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI) provides an easy way to select and use different open-source LLMs in your agentic applications to fully take advantage of their finetuned capabilities for specific tasks.

# Agentic translation on GaiaNet

Prof. Andrew Ng's [agentic translation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_github-andrewyngtranslation-agent-activity-7206347897938866176-5tDJ/) is a great demonstration on how to cooridnate multiple LLM ""agents"" to work on a single task. It allows multiple smaller LLMs (like Llama-3 or Gemma-2) to work gether and produce better results than a single large LLM (like ChatGPT).

[GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/), with 2000+ nodes running all kinds of finetuned LLms and knowledge bases, provides a huge opportunity for agentic apps to choose and use their own LLM backends.

## Introduction to the LLM Translation Agent

This LLM Translation Agent is designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use your own fine-tuned models or any LLMs on Hugging Face like Meta's Llama 3. 

> For detailed commands on starting and running this agent, please visit [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).

To get started, clone the Translation Agent.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Next, we will install a local GaiaNet node, which provides the backend API services required by the agent. You can, of course, use [GaiaNet nodes from the community](https://docs.gaianet.ai/user-guide/nodes) if you do not want to start your own.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
```

You will also need the following configurations and prerequisites to run the agent app. If you are using a public GaiaNet node instead of your local node, replace the `http://localhost:8080` with `https://node_id.us.gaianet.network`.

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""http://localhost:8080/v1""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Demo 1: Running Translation Agents with Llama-3-8B

First, let's run the translation agent with Meta AI's popular Llama-3 model. We select the smallest Llama-3 model (the 8b model) for this demo. The translation task is from Chinese to English. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City.

### Step 1.1: Run a Llama-3-8B GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 5.73 GB. It can take a while to download.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 1.2 Run the Translation Agent on top of Llama-3-8B

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 
  
```
import os
import translation_agent as ta
        
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.
   
```bash
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

Wait for several minutes and you will have [a fully translated version](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-Llama-3-8B) appear on your terminal screen.

## Demo 2: Running Translation Agents with gemma-2-27b

The benefit of running the Translation Agent with GaiaNet is the ability for users to choose and embed different LLMs for different agentic tasks. To demonstrate this point, we will now change the translation agent LLM from Llama-3-8b to Google's gemma-2-27b, which is of similar size but scores higher on many language-related benchmarks.

The translation task is the same as before. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City. The translation target is English.

### Step 2.1 Run a gemma-2-27b GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 6.40G, it could take a while to download.

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/gemma-2-27b-it/config.json
```    

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```
    
### Step 2.2 Run the Translation Agent to run on top of gemma-2-27b

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here,because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.

```
cd examples    
python example_script.py
```
    
You can find the translated result in English [here](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-gemma-2-27b).

## Demo 3: Running Translation Agents with Phi-3-Medium long context model

The Llama-3 and Gemma-2 models are great LLMs, but they have relatively small context windows. The agent requires all text to fit into the LLM context window, and that limits the size of articles they can translate. To fix this problem, we could select an open source LLM with a large context window. For this demo, we choose Microsoft's Phi-3-medium-128k model, which has a massive 128k (over 100 thousand words or the length of several books) context window.

We run [a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with the Varsaille Palace](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) through our Translation Agent powered by a Phi-3-medium-128k model we start locally.

### Step 3.1: Run a Phi-3-medium-128k GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. 

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/phi-3-medium-instruct-128k/config_full.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node with a 128k context window.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 3.2 Clone and run the Translation Agent on top of Phi-3-medium-128k

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(

    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts. 

## Conclusion

[GaiaNet](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI) provides an easy way to select and use different open-source LLMs in your agentic applications to fully take advantage of their finetuned capabilities for specific tasks.

# Agentic translation on GaiaNet

Prof. Andrew Ng's [agentic translation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_github-andrewyngtranslation-agent-activity-7206347897938866176-5tDJ/) is a great demonstration on how to cooridnate multiple LLM ""agents"" to work on a single task. It allows multiple smaller LLMs (like Llama-3 or Gemma-2) to work gether and produce better results than a single large LLM (like ChatGPT).

[GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/), with 2000+ nodes running all kinds of finetuned LLms and knowledge bases, provides a huge opportunity for agentic apps to choose and use their own LLM backends.

## Introduction to the LLM Translation Agent

This LLM Translation Agent is designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use your own fine-tuned models or any LLMs on Hugging Face like Meta's Llama 3. 

> For detailed commands on starting and running this agent, please visit [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).

To get started, clone the Translation Agent.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Next, we will install a local GaiaNet node, which provides the backend API services required by the agent. You can, of course, use [GaiaNet nodes from the community](https://docs.gaianet.ai/user-guide/nodes) if you do not want to start your own.

```
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
```

You will also need the following configurations and prerequisites to run the agent app. If you are using a public GaiaNet node instead of your local node, replace the `http://localhost:8080` with `https://node_id.us.gaianet.network`.

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""http://localhost:8080/v1""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Demo 1: Running Translation Agents with Llama-3-8B

First, let's run the translation agent with Meta AI's popular Llama-3 model. We select the smallest Llama-3 model (the 8b model) for this demo. The translation task is from Chinese to English. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City.

### Step 1.1: Run a Llama-3-8B GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 5.73 GB. It can take a while to download.

```
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/config.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 1.2 Run the Translation Agent on top of Llama-3-8B

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 
  
```
import os
import translation_agent as ta
        
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.
   
```bash
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

Wait for several minutes and you will have [a fully translated version](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-Llama-3-8B) appear on your terminal screen.

## Demo 2: Running Translation Agents with gemma-2-27b

The benefit of running the Translation Agent with GaiaNet is the ability for users to choose and embed different LLMs for different agentic tasks. To demonstrate this point, we will now change the translation agent LLM from Llama-3-8b to Google's gemma-2-27b, which is of similar size but scores higher on many language-related benchmarks.

The translation task is the same as before. Our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text) is in Chinese, a brief intro to the ancient Chinese royal palace, the Forbidden City. The translation target is English.

### Step 2.1 Run a gemma-2-27b GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. Since the size of the model is 6.40G, it could take a while to download.

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/gemma-2-27b-it/config.json
```    

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node.

```
gaianet start
```
    
### Step 2.2 Run the Translation Agent to run on top of gemma-2-27b

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""gemma-2-27b-it-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here,because we named our source text `forbiddencity.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. 

Run the below commands to have your text file translated into English.

```
cd examples    
python example_script.py
```
    
You can find the translated result in English [here](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#English-Translation-by-gemma-2-27b).

## Demo 3: Running Translation Agents with Phi-3-Medium long context model

The Llama-3 and Gemma-2 models are great LLMs, but they have relatively small context windows. The agent requires all text to fit into the LLM context window, and that limits the size of articles they can translate. To fix this problem, we could select an open source LLM with a large context window. For this demo, we choose Microsoft's Phi-3-medium-128k model, which has a massive 128k (over 100 thousand words or the length of several books) context window.

We run [a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with the Varsaille Palace](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) through our Translation Agent powered by a Phi-3-medium-128k model we start locally.

### Step 3.1: Run a Phi-3-medium-128k GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. 

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/phi-3-medium-instruct-128k/config_full.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node with a 128k context window.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 3.2 Clone and run the Translation Agent on top of Phi-3-medium-128k

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts.

","Q: 9. What is the model name for the first demo, translating from Chinese to English using Llama-3-8B?
A: The model name for the first demo, translating from Chinese to English using Llama-3-8B, is ""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"".

We run [a lengthy Chinese article on Forbidden City's collaboration with the Varsaille Palace](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) through our Translation Agent powered by a Phi-3-medium-128k model we start locally.

### Step 3.1: Run a Phi-3-medium-128k GaiaNet node

Configure and download the model. 

```    
gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/phi-3-medium-instruct-128k/config_full.json
```

Next, use the following command to start the GaiaNet node with a 128k context window.

```
gaianet start
```

### Step 3.2 Clone and run the Translation Agent on top of Phi-3-medium-128k

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the model name to the one you are using, here we’re using `Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language). 

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/long_article.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(
            source_lang=source_lang,
            target_lang=target_lang,
            source_text=source_text,
            country=country,
            model=""Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    )
    
    print(f""Translation:\n\n{translation}"")
```

Then, you can find an `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here, because we named our source text `long_article.txt`, the relative path to the document would be `sample-texts/long_article.txt`.

```
cd examples
python example_script.py
```

[The translated results were impressive,](https://hackmd.io/vuFYZTVsQZyKmkeQ3ThZQw?view#Source-text) with the translation capturing the nuances and context of the original text with high fidelity.

## Evaluation of Translation Quality

The three models, Llama-3-8B, gemma-2-27b, and Phi-3-medium, have exhibited varying levels of performance in translating complex historical and cultural content from Chinese to English.

Llama-3-8B provides a translation that effectively captures the factual content but shows occasional stiffness in language, possibly indicating a direct translation approach that doesn't fully adapt idiomatic expressions. It does not keep section title and the format of the original text and left certain part untranslated.

In contrast, The translation by gemma-2-27b is quite accurate and retains the original meaning of the short intro article of Forbidden city. gemma-2-27b's translation exhibits a smooth and natural English flow, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of both the source language and the target language’s grammatical structures. The choice of words and sentence structures in gemma-2-27b's output demonstrates a high degree of linguistic finesse, suggesting it might be well-suited for translating formal and historically nuanced texts.

The Phi-3-medium-128k model can translate book-length text from Chinese to English. It demonstrates robust capabilities in handling large volumes of complex content, suggesting advanced memory handling and contextual awareness. The quality of translation remains consistent even with increased text length, indicating Phi's utility in projects requiring extensive, detailed translations. But you can see it makes certain mistakes like mistaken ""Wenhua Hall"" as ""also known as Forbidden City"" in the first paragraph.

Overall, each model has its strengths, with gemma-2-27b standing out for linguistic finesse and Phi-3-medium-128k for handling lengthy texts. 

## Conclusion

[GaiaNet](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI) provides an easy way to select and use different open-source LLMs in your agentic applications to fully take advantage of their finetuned capabilities for specific tasks.

Once you have a local GaiaNet node up and running, you could share it with others and make $$$ by joining the [GaiaNet network](https://www.gaianet.ai/)!
","Q: 10. How does the translation process work when using the Translation Agent on top of an LLM?
A: The translation process when using the Translation Agent on top of an LLM (Language Model) is as follows:

1.  **Text Preprocessing**: The agent first reads the input text from a file or any other source. It may perform some preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, which breaks down the input text into individual words or subwords.
2.  **Model Initialization**: Before generating the translation, the Translation Agent needs to initialize the LLM by loading its model architecture and weights. This is typically done when you first start using a new model or when you update it with newer versions.
3.  **Text Encoding**: The agent then encodes the source text into a numerical representation that can be understood by the model. This encoding process allows the model to capture the semantic meaning of the input text and generate a corresponding output based on its internal representations.
4.  **Model Inference**: With the encoded input, the Translation Agent uses the LLM's inference mechanism to generate an initial translation or a set of possible translations for each word or sentence in the input sequence.
5.  **Post-processing**: The generated translation is then post-processed by the agent, which includes tasks such as decoding, where it converts the numerical representation back into human-readable text and removes any unnecessary symbols or special characters.
6.  **Final Output**: The final translated output is what you see in your terminal or interface after running the `python example_script.py` command.

This process can be customized further to accommodate specific requirements or fine-tune the translation results based on user needs.

### Bonus Tip: Fine-Tuning Your Model

If the Translation Agent does not meet your expectations for certain types of texts, you can consider fine-tuning your model. This is done by retraining your model with a smaller dataset that includes your target domain's language and terminology. For example, if you are translating financial reports into English, your fine-tuning data set could include various types of reports in your native language, allowing your model to learn more about financial jargon.

You can use pre-trained models like Llama-3 or Gemma2 as the base for this fine-tuned model. GaiaNet has tools available that simplify the process of fine-tuning these models."

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

**Response:**

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

**Response:**

","Q: 2. What information does the `chat/completions` endpoint return based on the system prompt and user query?
A: The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query. 

Here are some information it returns:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the chat completion.
- **object**: The object type, which is either ""chat.completion.chunk"" in streaming mode or ""chat.completion"" in non-streaming mode.
- **choices**: A list of chat completion choices.
  - Each choice includes an `index` field with a unique index value and a `message` field containing the LLM response. 
  - The `finish_reason` field indicates why the model has finished generating responses, such as ""stop"" or ""length"".
- **created**: The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the chat completion was created.
- **model**: The chat model used for the chat completion.
- **usage**: Usage statistics for the completion request, including `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `total_tokens`.
  
Additionally, you can specify parameters in your API request to control the type of response. For example:

- **stream**: If set to `true`, the endpoint returns partial responses as the LLM generates its answer.
- **top_p`: An alternative to sampling with temperature. Higher values make the output more random, while lower values focus the output and make it more deterministic.
- **temperature`: Higher values make the output more random, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic.
- **presence_penalty` : Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
- `frequency_penalty`: Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood of repeating the same line verbatim.

These parameters allow you to fine-tune your API requests and receive responses tailored to your specific needs. 

Here is an example response:

```
{
    ""id"": ""chatcmpl-73a1f57d-185e-42c2-b8a6-ba0bae58f3b4"",
    ""object"": ""chat.completion"",

            },

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

**Response:**

```

","Q: 3. How do you make the API respond with partial answers as the LLM generates its answer in non-streaming mode?
A: To make the API respond with partial answers as the LLM generates its answer in non-streaming mode, you need to set `stream=true` in your request.

Here is an example of a non-streaming request with `stream=true`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"", ""stream"": true}'
```

In non-streaming mode, setting `stream=true` will cause the API to send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. The responses will be sent in chunks, with each chunk containing a part of the final response.

However, if you still want the API to respond with full answers in non-streaming mode (even though it's sending partial responses), you can use the `stream=true&chunk_size=0` parameters in your request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"", ""stream"": true, ""chunk_size"": 0}'
```

This will cause the API to send back a full response in each chunk, effectively disabling the streaming feature.

**Bonus tip**: You can also set `chunk_size` to any positive integer value to control the size of each chunk. A larger value will result in fewer chunks being sent, while a smaller value will result in more chunks being sent. For example, setting `chunk_size=1024` would cause the API to send back a 1 KB chunk for every part of the final response.

```bash
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"", ""stream"": true, ""chunk_size"": 1024}'
```

This can be useful for fine-tuning the API's behavior to suit your specific use case."

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

","Q: 4. What are the fields available for customization in the request body of the `embeddings` endpoint?
A: The `embeddings` endpoint in GaiaNet allows for customization of the input and other parameters. The following fields are available for customization in the request body:

*   `model`: Specify the embedding model to use. For example, you can use ""nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16"".
*   `input`: This is a list of text inputs for which embeddings will be computed. Each input should be a string or an array of strings.
*   `max_output_tokens`: The maximum number of output tokens (default: 2048).
*   `temperature`: A value between -1000 and 1 (inclusive), controlling the output temperature, which affects the randomness of the generated embeddings (default: 1.5).

Here is an example of a customized request:

```json
{
    ""model"": ""nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16"",
    ""input"": [
        ""This is a test string."",
        ""Another input for the embedding model.""
    ],
    ""max_output_tokens"": 512,
    ""temperature"": -0.2
}
```

Note that these fields can be adjusted based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of the chosen model."

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

**Response:**

","Q: 5. What is the purpose of the `retrieve` endpoint?
A: The `retrieve` endpoint is used to retrieve text from the node's vector collection based on the user's query. This means that if a similar piece of text has been indexed in the node, it can be retrieved when the same or similar query is made.

For example, if you make a request like this:

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/retrieve \
    -H 'accept:application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the location of Paris?""}], ""model"":""nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16""}'
```

The node will search its vector collection and return any similar pieces of text it has indexed, along with their scores.

This endpoint is useful for applications where you want to leverage existing knowledge in your model or database, such as:

* Retrieving related information when a user asks a question
* Providing suggestions based on previous conversations
* Enhancing the accuracy of responses by drawing from similar examples

**Example use case:**

A chatbot is designed to provide information about travel destinations. When a user asks ""What is the location of Paris?"", the `retrieve` endpoint can be used to search for similar pieces of text in the node's vector collection, such as descriptions of Paris or its geographical location. The most relevant matches are then returned to the chatbot, which can use this information to provide a more accurate and helpful response.

**Tips:**

* When using the `retrieve` endpoint, make sure to configure the scoring threshold correctly, so you don't retrieve irrelevant results.
* You may want to index your data before making requests to the `retrieve` endpoint. This can be done by creating an embedding model and passing it through the node's API.
* Experiment with different query parameters to optimize the performance of the `retrieve` endpoint for your specific use case."

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

","Q: 6. What information does the `models` endpoint provide about the chat and embedding models available on the node?
A: The `models` endpoint provides the following information about the chat and embedding models available on the node:

*   **Model ID**: A unique identifier for each model.
*   **Creation Time**: The timestamp when the model was created.
*   **Type**: Whether it's a chat or an embedding model.
*   **Prompt Template**: The default prompt template used by the model.
*   **n_predict**: The number of predictions made by the model in one pass.
*   **n_gpu_layers**: The number of GPU layers used by the model.
*   **Context Size**: The size of the context window used by the model.
*   **Batch Size**: The batch size used for training and inference with the model.
*   **Temperature**: A hyperparameter controlling the randomness of the model's predictions.
*   **Top_p**: A hyperparameter controlling the probability threshold for predicting new tokens.
*   **Repeat Penalty**: A hyperparameter that penalizes repeated tokens in the output.
*   **Presence Penalty**: A hyperparameter that penalizes tokens based on their presence in the input.
*   **Frequency Penalty**: A hyperparameter that penalizes tokens based on their frequency of occurrence.

This information can be useful for understanding the capabilities and limitations of each model, as well as for fine-tuning or configuring them to suit specific tasks and applications."

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

**Response:**

# API Reference

## Introduction

Each GaiaNet node is an OpenAI compatibale API server. You can build your application based on the GaiaNet node API. You
can also replace OpenAI API configuration with the GaiaNet node API in other AI agent frameworks.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1`.

## Endpoints

### Chat

The `chat/completions` endpoint returns an LLM response based on the system prompt and user query.

#### Non-streaming

By default, the API responds with a full answer in the HTTP response. 

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name""}'
```

**Response:**

```
{""id"":""chatcmpl-bcfeebe0-5372-42c0-ac92-0615213e1c97"",""object"":""chat.completion"",""created"":1716380086,""model"":""Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k-Q5_K_M"",""choices"":[{""index"":0,""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""Paris.""},""finish_reason"":""stop""}],""usage"":{""prompt_tokens"":61,""completion_tokens"":4,""total_tokens"":65}}%  
```

#### streaming

Add `""stream"":true` in your request to make the API send back partial responses as the LLM generates its answer. 

**Request:**

```
curl -X POST https://node_id.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'accept:application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""}, {""role"":""user"", ""content"": ""What is the capital of France?""}], ""model"": ""model_name"", ""stream"":true}'
```

        ""prompt_tokens"": 61,
        ""completion_tokens"": 4,
        ""total_tokens"": 65
    }
}
```

In the above response, the `usage` field provides the following statistics:

*   **Prompt tokens**: The number of tokens in the user's input or prompt.
*   **Completion tokens**: The number of tokens generated by the model as part of the completion.
*   **Total tokens**: The sum of the prompt and completion tokens.

These usage statistics can be useful for tracking and analyzing the performance of your chatbot, including its ability to understand user inputs, generate relevant responses, and engage with users effectively."

# Agent Zero

[Agent Zero](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero) is a general purpose AI agent application. You can simply ask it to accomplish tasks on the command line. 
It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as users use it. It leverages your computer as a tool to accomplish your tasks.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node to provide LLM services to the agent app. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use the public [Llama-3.1-8B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) to power the Agent Zero.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | llama |
| Embedding | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | nomic-embed |

**You will also need to make sure your Docker engine is running.** Because the Agent Zero framework will leverage Docker to execute the generated code.

> You can start a local LLM service using [Gaia](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) or [LlamaEdge](https://llamaedge.com/docs/user-guide/quick-start-command) or [Moxin](https://github.com/moxin-org/moxin), and then use `http://localhost:8080/v1/` as the LLM API service endpoint URL.

## Configure the agent

First, we will need to get the source code of a Gaia-compatible version of Agent Zero.

```
git clone https://github.com/JYC0413/agent-zero-gaia.git
cd agent-zero-gaia
```

Then, let's install the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, let's configure the gaia node and other parameters.

```
cp example.env .env
```

You will need to configure the following items:

* `CHAT_MODEL_BASE_URL`: URL for the LLM API base URL. E.g., `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/`
* `CHAT_MODEL_NAME`: Name of the chat model to be used. E.g., `llama`
* `CHAT_API_KEY`: An API key to access the LLM services. You can enter several random characters here. E.g., `GAIA`
* `EMBEDDING_MODEL_BASE_URL`: URL for the embedding model API base URL. E.g., `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/`
* `EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`: Name of the embedding model name. E.g., `nomic-embed`
* `EMBEDDING_API_KEY`: An API key to access the embedding services. You can enter several random characters here. E.g., `GAIA`

## Run the agnet

Finally, let's run the Agent Zero application backed by the [Llama 3.1 8b](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) Gaia node.

```
python main.py
```

You can interact with Agent Zero via the command line. You will see the Agent Zero framework will call the related tools and execute some code to complete your task.

### Example 1

Get time in berlin and seattle

![](agent-zero-01.png)

![](agent-zero-02.png)

Save the above result in a file using node.js

![](agent-zero-03.png)

### Example 2

Install [mc](https://midnight-commander.org/). do not use `-y` flag

![](agent-zero-04.png)

### Example 3

Run `top`, show the system load

![](agent-zero-05.png)

### Example 4

Memorize my openai api key - 563434643464

![](agent-zero-06.png)

### Example 5

Extract an mp3 audio track from a mp4 video file using ffmpeg. You will need to put an mp4 file (e.g., `video.mp4`) into the `work_dir` and tell the agent about it.

","Q: What type of service does Gaia node provide for the agent app?
A: According to the provided context, a Gaia node provides Large Language Model (LLM) services for the Agent Zero application. The LLM service is used to power the Agent Zero's ability to accomplish tasks on the command line.

More specifically, the Gaia node provides two types of services:

1. **Chat Service**: This service enables the Agent Zero to have conversations and understand natural language commands.
2. **Embedding Service**: This service allows the Agent Zero to extract embeddings from text inputs, which are numerical representations of words or phrases that can be used for various tasks such as semantic similarity analysis.

These LLM services are accessed through APIs provided by the Gaia node, allowing the Agent Zero to leverage its capabilities to complete tasks and provide useful output."

# Agent Zero

[Agent Zero](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero) is a general purpose AI agent application. You can simply ask it to accomplish tasks on the command line. 
It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as users use it. It leverages your computer as a tool to accomplish your tasks.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node to provide LLM services to the agent app. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use the public [Llama-3.1-8B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) to power the Agent Zero.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | llama |
| Embedding | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | nomic-embed |

**You will also need to make sure your Docker engine is running.** Because the Agent Zero framework will leverage Docker to execute the generated code.

> You can start a local LLM service using [Gaia](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) or [LlamaEdge](https://llamaedge.com/docs/user-guide/quick-start-command) or [Moxin](https://github.com/moxin-org/moxin), and then use `http://localhost:8080/v1/` as the LLM API service endpoint URL.

## Configure the agent

First, we will need to get the source code of a Gaia-compatible version of Agent Zero.

```
git clone https://github.com/JYC0413/agent-zero-gaia.git
cd agent-zero-gaia
```

Then, let's install the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, let's configure the gaia node and other parameters.

```
cp example.env .env
```

You will need to configure the following items:

* `CHAT_MODEL_BASE_URL`: URL for the LLM API base URL. E.g., `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/`
* `CHAT_MODEL_NAME`: Name of the chat model to be used. E.g., `llama`
* `CHAT_API_KEY`: An API key to access the LLM services. You can enter several random characters here. E.g., `GAIA`
* `EMBEDDING_MODEL_BASE_URL`: URL for the embedding model API base URL. E.g., `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/`
* `EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`: Name of the embedding model name. E.g., `nomic-embed`
* `EMBEDDING_API_KEY`: An API key to access the embedding services. You can enter several random characters here. E.g., `GAIA`

## Run the agnet

Finally, let's run the Agent Zero application backed by the [Llama 3.1 8b](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) Gaia node.

```
python main.py
```

You can interact with Agent Zero via the command line. You will see the Agent Zero framework will call the related tools and execute some code to complete your task.

### Example 1

Get time in berlin and seattle

![](agent-zero-01.png)

![](agent-zero-02.png)

Save the above result in a file using node.js

![](agent-zero-03.png)

### Example 2

Install [mc](https://midnight-commander.org/). do not use `-y` flag

![](agent-zero-04.png)

### Example 3

Run `top`, show the system load

![](agent-zero-05.png)

### Example 4

Memorize my openai api key - 563434643464

![](agent-zero-06.png)

### Example 5

Extract an mp3 audio track from a mp4 video file using ffmpeg. You will need to put an mp4 file (e.g., `video.mp4`) into the `work_dir` and tell the agent about it.

","Q: Where can you find instructions on how to run your own Gaia node?
A: You can find instructions on how to run your own Gaia node in the GaiaNet-AI [node guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).

Additionally, you can refer to the following resources:

* [Gaia Node Configuration Guide](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main)
* [Llama-3.1-8B Node Configuration](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct)

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to follow the instructions carefully and test your node before using it with Agent Zero or other applications.

Here are some examples of how you can use a Gaia node:

* Use [LlamaEdge](https://llamaedge.com/docs/user-guide/quick-start-command) as your LLM service.
* Run your own node using the [Gaia Node Configuration Guide](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main).
* Use a public node like [Llama-3.1-8B](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct).

For example, you can run a local LLM service using Gaia and then use `http://localhost:8080/v1/` as the LLM API service endpoint URL.

```
git clone https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs.git
cd node-configs
python main.py

","Q: Can you use a public node as an alternative to running your own node?
A: Yes, you can use a public node as an alternative to running your own node. In the context of Agent Zero and Gaia, a public node refers to a shared LLM (Large Language Model) service that is available over the internet.

To use a public node with Agent Zero, you will need to configure your `~/.env` file to point to the URL of the public node's API. For example, if you want to use the [Llama 3.1 8B](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) public node, your `~/.env` file should contain the following settings:

```
CHAT_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/
CHAT_MODEL_NAME=llama
EMBEDDING_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=nomic-embed
```

Once you have configured the public node's URL, you can run Agent Zero using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

When you interact with Agent Zero via the command line, it will use the public node to access LLM services and complete your tasks.

Here are some pros and cons of using a public node:

**Pros:**

*   Easy setup: You don't need to run or manage your own node.
*   Accessible from anywhere: Public nodes are usually available over the internet, so you can use them from any location.
*   Reduced costs: You won't incur the costs associated with running and maintaining a private node.

**Cons:**

*   Security concerns: Public nodes may expose your data to third-party risks if not properly configured or encrypted.
*   Performance limitations: Public nodes might experience performance issues due to shared resources, traffic, or congestion.
*   Potential for downtime: Public nodes can experience outages or maintenance periods, which may affect Agent Zero's functionality.

In summary, using a public node with Agent Zero provides an easy-to-set-up and accessible alternative to running your own node. However, consider the potential trade-offs in terms of security, performance, and reliability before choosing this option."

","Q: Is it necessary to start a local LLM service using Gaia, LlamaEdge, or Moxin for the agent to work?
A: No, it is not necessary to start a local LLM service using Gaia, LlamaEdge, or Moxin for the Agent Zero to work. The text explicitly states that you can use a public node instead of running your own local LLM service.

In fact, the example provided in the tutorial uses a public [Llama-3.1-8B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) to power the Agent Zero application.

As long as you have access to a Gaia node (either public or private), you can use it to provide LLM services to the agent app without running your own local LLM service.

**Bonus Tip:** If you do decide to run your own local LLM service using Gaia, LlamaEdge, or Moxin, make sure to configure the `http://localhost:8080/v1/` as the LLM API service endpoint URL in the `.env` file. This will allow the Agent Zero to connect to your local LLM service instead of a public one."

# Anything LLM

Anything LLM is the all-in-one Desktop & Docker AI application with full RAG and AI Agent capabilities. You can configure Anything LLM using the GaiaNet node as the LLM backend. 

It's recommended to start a node without any snapshots, like [this one](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-8b-instruct).

## Steps

First, we will need to add GaiaNet Node as the LLM chat model and embedding model.

* Go to Settings
* Choose Local AI as the LLM provider in the LLM inference section. Then copy and paste the GaiaNet node API base URL in the LocalAI Base URL. The chat model and embedding model along with your node will be loaded automatically. Choose the chat model here and input the context length. Remember to click on Save Changes to make the changes take effect.

![](anything-llm-01.png)

* Then go to the Embedding Preference section and choose LocalAI as the embedding provider. Then copy and paste the GaiaNet node API base URL in the LocalAI Base URL. The chat model and embedding model along with your node will be loaded automatically. Choose the embedding model here and input the max embedding chunk length. Don't forget to click on Save Changes to make the changes take effect.

The above operations make the GaiaNet node as the LLM backend.

Second, let's set up the data source. You can upload a file or use the data connectors provided by Anything LLM.

![](anything-llm-02.png)

When you move a data source to the workspace, Anything LLM will call the GaiaNet node's embedding API to chunk and compute embeddings for your documentation, which may take some minutes.

That's it. When the embedding is done, go back to your workspace and ask a question. 

![](anything-llm-03.png)

> You can check out the `start-llamaedge.log` to check what happens.
","Summary:
This is a tutorial on how to use Anything LLM, an all-in-one Desktop & Docker AI application with full RAG and AI Agent capabilities. Here's a step-by-step summary:

**Step 1: Configure GaiaNet Node as the LLM Backend**

1. Go to Settings and choose Local AI as the LLM provider in the LLM inference section.
2. Copy and paste the GaiaNet node API base URL into the LocalAI Base URL field.
3. Choose the chat model and input the context length, then click Save Changes.

> You can check out the `start-llamaedge.log` to check what happens.
","Q: What model should you choose from the options when setting up the chat model?
A: When setting up the chat model in Anything LLM, you should choose a model that is suitable for your specific use case and requirements. GaiaNet provides different models with varying capabilities, and the choice of model will depend on the complexity of the conversations you want to have.

Here are some general guidelines to consider when choosing a chat model:

1.  **Llama-3**: This is a medium-sized model that can handle most conversational tasks, such as answering questions, generating text, and engaging in basic dialogues. It's a good starting point for most users.
2.  **Llama-3-8b-instruct**: This is an upgraded version of the Llama-3 model, with more parameters (8 billion) and improved performance. It's suitable for more complex conversations, such as those requiring long-form responses or nuanced understanding of context.

When deciding between these two options, consider the following factors:

*   **Conversational complexity**: If you need to have more in-depth and nuanced conversations, Llama-3-8b-instruct might be a better choice. However, if your conversations are relatively straightforward, Llama-3 should suffice.
*   **Model size and computational resources**: The larger model (Llama-3-8b-instruct) requires more computational resources and may take longer to load. If you're working with limited resources or a slower computer, the smaller model might be a better option.

Ultimately, the choice of chat model will depend on your specific needs and preferences. You can experiment with both options and see which one works best for you.

**Bonus Tip:** When working with large models like Llama-3-8b-instruct, make sure to save your progress regularly, as it may take some time to reload the model in case of a crash or interruption.

In terms of examples outside of this content, consider these scenarios:

*   **Customer support**: If you're creating a customer support chatbot, Llama-3 might be sufficient for handling common issues and providing basic assistance.
*   **Content generation**: For more complex content generation tasks, such as writing articles or generating marketing copy, Llama-3-8b-instruct could be a better choice due to its ability to handle longer responses and nuanced context.
*   **Research-oriented conversations**: If you're working on research projects that require in-depth discussions and analysis, Llama-3-8b-instruct might be more suitable for handling these complex conversations."

![](anything-llm-03.png)

> You can check out the `start-llamaedge.log` to check what happens.
","Q: What length should you input for the context when setting up the chat model?
A: When setting up the chat model in Anything LLM, the context length is an important parameter that can impact the performance and accuracy of the model.

The optimal context length depends on several factors, including:

1. **Model capacity**: Larger models like LLaMA-3 can handle longer contexts than smaller models.
2. **User interaction style**: If you tend to ask follow-up questions or provide lengthy input, a larger context length might be beneficial.
3. **Task complexity**: For more complex tasks, such as summarization or question-answering, a larger context length may help the model better understand the context.

As a general guideline, for LLaMA-3 (the chat model mentioned in the documentation), you can start with a context length of:

* 1024 tokens for simple tasks like conversation and text generation
* 2048 tokens for more complex tasks or when engaging in longer conversations

However, it's essential to note that excessively long contexts may lead to slower response times or even cause the model to fail due to memory constraints.

Here are some bonus tips:

* **Monitor performance**: Keep an eye on the model's performance and adjust the context length accordingly. If you notice the model struggling to respond accurately, consider shortening the context.
* **Experiment with different lengths**: Try varying the context length to see what works best for your specific use case.
* **Consider model limitations**: Remember that even with a large context length, some models may still struggle with extremely long or complex input.

To illustrate this, let's consider an example outside of the content:

Imagine you're using Anything LLM to generate a short story. If you input a 5-sentence prompt, a context length of 1024 tokens might be sufficient. However, if your prompt is a 100-sentence passage or a complex mathematical problem, you may need to increase the context length to ensure accurate results.

Remember to monitor performance and adjust the context length accordingly based on your specific needs!"

By choosing LocalAI, you are telling Anything LLLM to use the same GaiaNet node API base URL that you provided earlier in the LLM inference section. This way, the chat model and embedding model along with your node will be loaded automatically, and you can configure the embedding model and input the max embedding chunk length.

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to click on Save Changes after making any changes to the Embedding Preference section to ensure that the updates take effect. Also, keep an eye on the `start-llamaedge.log` file to see what happens during the embedding process."

# Anything LLM

Anything LLM is the all-in-one Desktop & Docker AI application with full RAG and AI Agent capabilities. You can configure Anything LLM using the GaiaNet node as the LLM backend. 

It's recommended to start a node without any snapshots, like [this one](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-8b-instruct).

## Steps

First, we will need to add GaiaNet Node as the LLM chat model and embedding model.

* Go to Settings
* Choose Local AI as the LLM provider in the LLM inference section. Then copy and paste the GaiaNet node API base URL in the LocalAI Base URL. The chat model and embedding model along with your node will be loaded automatically. Choose the chat model here and input the context length. Remember to click on Save Changes to make the changes take effect.

![](anything-llm-01.png)

* Then go to the Embedding Preference section and choose LocalAI as the embedding provider. Then copy and paste the GaiaNet node API base URL in the LocalAI Base URL. The chat model and embedding model along with your node will be loaded automatically. Choose the embedding model here and input the max embedding chunk length. Don't forget to click on Save Changes to make the changes take effect.

The above operations make the GaiaNet node as the LLM backend.

Second, let's set up the data source. You can upload a file or use the data connectors provided by Anything LLM.

![](anything-llm-02.png)

When you move a data source to the workspace, Anything LLM will call the GaiaNet node's embedding API to chunk and compute embeddings for your documentation, which may take some minutes.

That's it. When the embedding is done, go back to your workspace and ask a question. 

![](anything-llm-03.png)

> You can check out the `start-llamaedge.log` to check what happens.
","Q: What URL do you copy and paste into the LocalAI Base URL in the Embedding Preference section?
A: To copy and paste into the LocalAI Base URL in the Embedding Preference section, you need to obtain the API base URL of your GaiaNet node. 

You can find this by going to the [node-configs repository](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-8b-instruct) and clicking on the link provided in the ""Recommended"" section, which is a GitHub repository that contains pre-configured node configurations.

In this case, you would copy the `base_url` from the [Llama 3.8B Instruct](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/blob/main/llama-3-8b-instruct/node.json) file. 

For example, it might look something like:
```
{
    ...
    ""base_url"": ""https://your-gaianet-node-url.com/api/v1"",
    ...
}
```
You would then copy the `base_url` value (in this case, `https://your-gaianet-node-url.com/api/v1`) and paste it into the LocalAI Base URL field in the Embedding Preference section.

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to replace `https://your-gaianet-node-url.com/api/v1` with your actual GaiaNet node's API base URL, or the embedding will not work as expected."

> You can check out the `start-llamaedge.log` to check what happens.
","Q: What model should you choose from the options when setting up the embedding model?
A: When setting up the embedding model in Anything LLM, you should choose the model that is compatible with your GaiaNet node and suitable for your specific use case.

In this case, since you're using a GaiaNet node as the LLM backend, it's recommended to use the **Default Embedding Model** provided by GaiaNet. This model is specifically designed to work seamlessly with GaiaNet nodes and will ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

The other options may not be compatible with your GaiaNet node or might require additional configuration, which can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

For example, if you choose the **DistilBERT Embedding Model**, it might not be optimized for your specific use case, leading to slower performance or less accurate results. Similarly, using a custom embedding model without proper calibration and tuning may result in suboptimal performance.

Therefore, sticking with the default embedding model provided by GaiaNet is usually the safest and most recommended choice when setting up the embedding model.

**Bonus Tip**: When choosing an embedding model, consider the specific characteristics of your data and use case. For instance, if you're working with a large amount of text data, you might want to choose an embedding model that's designed for long-form text analysis. Always refer to the documentation and guidelines provided by GaiaNet or the specific embedding model you're using to make informed decisions."

","Q: Can you run your own Gaia node to provide LLM services?
A: Yes, you can run your own Gaia node to provide LLM services. Gaia is an open-source framework that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage large language models (LLMs) at scale.

To run a Gaia node, you will need to follow these general steps:

1. **Set up the infrastructure**: You'll need a server or cluster with sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth) to host your Gaia node.
2. **Download and install Gaia**: Get the Gaia source code from GitHub and build it according to the instructions provided in the README file.
3. **Configure the node**: You'll need to configure the node by setting up a configuration file that specifies the model architecture, training data, and other relevant parameters.
4. **Train or import a model**: You can either train your own LLM from scratch or import a pre-trained model using Gaia's built-in tools.
5. **Deploy the node**: Once you have your model trained or imported, you can deploy the node by running the Gaia service.

Here are some additional tips and considerations when setting up a Gaia node:

* **Choose the right hardware**: Depending on the size of your LLM and the number of requests you expect to handle, you may need high-performance hardware, such as NVIDIA GPUs or multi-core CPUs.
* **Monitor performance and resource utilization**: Keep an eye on your node's CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk space to ensure it remains stable and efficient.
* **Implement security measures**: Ensure that your Gaia node is secure by implementing measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect sensitive data.
* **Follow best practices for LLM deployment**: Familiarize yourself with best practices for deploying LLMs at scale, including techniques for optimizing performance, managing model updates, and ensuring reliability.

Here are some additional resources that can help you get started:

* [Gaia documentation](https://gaianet.github.io/docs/)
* [Gaia GitHub repository](https://github.com/gaianet/gaia)
* [LLM deployment best practices](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/large-language-models/)

By following these steps and tips, you can successfully run your own Gaia node to provide LLM services."

","Q: What is the extra string that needs to be included at the end of the API endpoint URL?
A: According to the CodeGPT tutorial, the extra string that needs to be included at the end of the API endpoint URL is ""v1/"".

So, if you're using the public CodeStral nodes as an example, your complete API base URL would be:
```
https://codestral.us.gaianet.network/v1/
```

**Bonus Tip:** Make sure to include this extra string exactly as it's written. A single typo or extra character could prevent the CodeGPT plugin from connecting to the LLM backend.

**Example Outside of Content:** Let's say you're using a different public node, e.g., ""https://example-node.gaianet.network"". You would need to append the ""v1/"" string to get the complete API base URL:
```
https://example-node.gaianet.network/v1/
```"

those IDEs. You can easily configure it to use Gaia nodes as LLM backends. In fact, you can choose different Gaia 
nodes for

* The autocomplete model for coding tasks.
* The chat model for understanding and discussing code.
* The embedding model to provide chat context based on local files.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [Run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [Use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use public nodes to power the Continue plugin.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | gemma |
| Embedding | https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | nomic |
| Autocompletion | https://codestral.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | codestral |

> It is important to note that Continue requires the API endpoint to include a `/` at the end.

## Install Continue

[Load this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) to install the Continue IDE plugin.  
It will open up your VSCode when you click on the **Install** button on the web page. When you are
asked to configure Continue, just click on **Skip** and finish the installation without selecting a local model.

## Configure Continue

Click on the gear icon on the toolbar to load the `config.json` file for the Continue plugin. The file is located
in your own home directory `$HOME/.continue/config.json`.
You can now change the `config.json` file as follows. 
It asks the Continue plugin to use different public Gaia nodes and models for 
chat, code autocomplete and embeddings.

```
{
  ""models"": [
    {
      ""model"": ""gemma"",
      ""title"": ""LlamaEdge"",
      ""apiBase"": ""https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1/"",
      ""provider"": ""openai""
    }
  ],
  ""tabAutocompleteModel"": {
      ""title"": ""Autocomplete"",
      ""apiBase"": ""https://codestral.us.gaianet.network/v1/"",
      ""model"": ""codestral"",

  },

  },
  ""customCommands"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""test"",
      ""prompt"": ""{{{ input }}}\n\nWrite a comprehensive set of unit tests for the selected code. It should setup, run tests that check for correctness including important edge cases, and teardown. Ensure that the tests are complete and sophisticated. Give the tests just as chat output, don't edit any file."",
      ""description"": ""Write unit tests for highlighted code""
    }
  ],
  ""allowAnonymousTelemetry"": true
}
```

Save the `config.json` file and you are done!

## Use the plugin

The following screenshot shows how you can chat with an error message
inside the IDE.

","Q: What is the purpose of the `customCommands` section in the `config.json` file?
A: The `customCommands` section in the `config.json` file allows you to define custom commands that can be used within the Continue plugin.

A custom command is a predefined prompt or set of prompts that can be invoked using a specific name. When you invoke a custom command, Continue will use the associated prompt to generate chat output or provide additional functionality.

The `customCommands` section is an array of objects, where each object represents a single custom command. Each object has three properties:

*   **name**: The name of the custom command that can be used to invoke it.
*   **prompt**: A template string that defines the prompt used by Continue to generate chat output when the command is invoked. You can use placeholders like `{{{ input }}}` to insert user-inputted values into the prompt.
*   **description**: A short description of what the custom command does.

Here's an example from the provided code:
```json
""customCommands"": [
  {
    ""name"": ""test"",
    ""prompt"": ""{{{ input }}}\n\nWrite a comprehensive set of unit tests for the selected code. It should setup, run tests that check for correctness including important edge cases, and teardown. Ensure that the tests are complete and sophisticated. Give the tests just as chat output, don't edit any file."",
    ""description"": ""Write unit tests for highlighted code""
  }
]
```

To use a custom command within Continue:

1.  Open a project in your IDE.
2.  Select some code by highlighting it.
3.  Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.
4.  Type the name of your custom command (`test`, in this case).
5.  Continue will generate chat output with unit tests for the selected code.

**Bonus Tip**: You can customize the behavior of a custom command by using different placeholders, such as `{{{ file }}}` to insert a file path or `{{{ selection }}}` to insert the currently selected text.

**Example outside of this context**: Suppose you're working on an open-source project and want to create a custom command that generates API documentation based on your code. You could define a custom command like this:
```json
""customCommands"": [
  {
    ""name"": ""apidoc"",
    ""prompt"": ""{{{ file }}}\n\nGenerate detailed API documentation for the selected module, including class descriptions and method signatures."",
    ""description"": ""Generate API documentation for highlighted code""
  }
]
```
This command would allow you to generate API documentation by invoking it within Continue and selecting a module to document. The prompt would use the `{{{ file }}}` placeholder to insert the path to the selected module, allowing Continue to generate accurate documentation based on the module's code."

A: When you click on the **Install** button on the web page, VSCode will automatically open up your local installation directory.

However, if you're asking where the actual installation takes place, when you install a VS Code extension from the Marketplace using the **Install** button, the extension is installed in the following directory:

```
%APPDATA%\Code\User\extensions
(on Windows)
~/.vscode/extensions
(on macOS or Linux)
```

These directories contain all the extensions and settings for your local VS Code installation.

So, if you're trying to find the installation location of Continue, it's not necessarily tied to the web page click action, but rather where VSCode stores its extensions."

# Cursor AI IDE

[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) is an AI-powered code editor / IDE. Using LLMs to generate and review code, Cursor is an alternative to the very popular GitHub Copilot. 
You can use Cursor with your own Gaia node as the LLM backend. There are two big reasons for that

* Your Gaia node could be supplemented by a knowledge base that is specific to your proprietary code repository, programming language choices, and coding guidelines / styles.
* Your Gaia node could ensure that your code stays private within your organization.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node to provide LLM API services. You can

* [Run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [Use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public [Llama 3.1 8b](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) node to power Cursor.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | llama |

> A limitation of Cursor is that it does not support local LLM services. A Gaia node comes with a default networking tunnel that turns your local LLM service into a HTTPS service accessible from the Internet. That allows Cursor to use your own private LLM for coding. Start your own [Llama 3.1](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) or [Phi 3.5](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/phi-3.5-mini-instruct) models today! Both are quite good at coding tasks.

## Configure Cursor

First, download and install [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). Click on the **Settings** button on the top right. Then, click on **Models** to configure the backend LLM service.

Second, add a model named `llama` and turn off all the other models like `gpt-4o`.

Third, go to the OpenAI API Key section,

* Click on **Override OpenAI Base URL**. Type `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` here.
* For the OpenAI API key, you can use any random chars such as `GAIA`. Click on **Verify** to test if the connection is correct.

## Use Cursor

You can use 

* **command + K** to edit the highlighted code
* **command + L** to open the chat room and ask questions about the code.

","Summary:
**Cursor AI IDE Tutorial**

**Overview**
------------

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor/IDE that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and review code. It is an alternative to GitHub Copilot. In this tutorial, we will learn how to configure Cursor with a public Gaia node as the LLM backend.

**Prerequisites**
----------------

* A Gaia node providing LLM API services. You can either:
	+ Run your own node by following the [quick-start guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
	+ Use a public node (e.g., [Llama 3.1 8b](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct))

**Configure Cursor**
-------------------

### Step 1: Download and Install Cursor

* Visit the [Cursor website](https://www.cursor.com/) to download and install the IDE.

### Step 2: Configure LLM Service

* In Cursor, go to **Settings** > **Models**
* Add a new model named `llama`
* Turn off all other models (e.g., `gpt-4o`)
* Go to **OpenAI API Key**
* Click on **Override OpenAI Base URL** and enter `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1`
* For the OpenAI API key, use any random characters such as `GAIA`. Click on **Verify** to test the connection

### Step 3: Verify LLM Service Connection

* After configuring the LLM service, verify that it is working correctly by clicking on the **Verify** button
* If everything is set up correctly, you should see a success message indicating that the connection was successful

**Using Cursor**
----------------

* To use the AI-powered code generation features in Cursor, simply select the highlighted code and press **command + K** to edit it
* Press **command + L** to open the chat room and ask questions about the code

Note: A limitation of Cursor is that it does not support local LLM services. However, you can start your own [Llama 3.1](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) or [Phi 3.5](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/phi-3.5-mini-instruct) models to use with Cursor."

","Q: Is Cursor an AI-powered code editor/IDE?
A: Yes, Cursor is an AI-powered code editor/IDE. It uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and review code, making it an alternative to popular tools like GitHub Copilot.

**Bonus Tip:** As mentioned in the text, you can use your own Gaia node as the LLM backend for Cursor, which allows you to customize the knowledge base with proprietary code repository information, programming language choices, and coding guidelines/styles. This ensures that your code stays private within your organization.

Example: Suppose you're working on a project with sensitive data, and you want to keep it confidential. By using your own Gaia node as the LLM backend for Cursor, you can ensure that the AI-powered code editing capabilities are restricted to only use your proprietary knowledge base, keeping your code secure.

In short, Cursor leverages the power of AI to provide advanced coding assistance, making it a valuable tool for developers and teams."

# Cursor AI IDE

[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) is an AI-powered code editor / IDE. Using LLMs to generate and review code, Cursor is an alternative to the very popular GitHub Copilot. 
You can use Cursor with your own Gaia node as the LLM backend. There are two big reasons for that

* Your Gaia node could be supplemented by a knowledge base that is specific to your proprietary code repository, programming language choices, and coding guidelines / styles.
* Your Gaia node could ensure that your code stays private within your organization.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node to provide LLM API services. You can

* [Run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [Use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public [Llama 3.1 8b](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) node to power Cursor.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/ | llama |

> A limitation of Cursor is that it does not support local LLM services. A Gaia node comes with a default networking tunnel that turns your local LLM service into a HTTPS service accessible from the Internet. That allows Cursor to use your own private LLM for coding. Start your own [Llama 3.1](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3.1-8b-instruct) or [Phi 3.5](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/phi-3.5-mini-instruct) models today! Both are quite good at coding tasks.

## Configure Cursor

First, download and install [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). Click on the **Settings** button on the top right. Then, click on **Models** to configure the backend LLM service.

Second, add a model named `llama` and turn off all the other models like `gpt-4o`.

Third, go to the OpenAI API Key section,

* Click on **Override OpenAI Base URL**. Type `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` here.
* For the OpenAI API key, you can use any random chars such as `GAIA`. Click on **Verify** to test if the connection is correct.

## Use Cursor

You can use 

* **command + K** to edit the highlighted code
* **command + L** to open the chat room and ask questions about the code.
  
![](cursor-02.png)
","Q: Which programming language choices does Cursor support?
A: Cursor is designed to support a wide range of programming languages, including but not limited to:

* Python
* JavaScript (including Node.js)
* TypeScript
* Java
* C++
* C#
* Ruby
* PHP

In fact, Cursor supports over 40 programming languages and frameworks. This is because it uses large language models like Llama 3.1 to generate code in various languages.

According to the [Cursor documentation](https://cursor.com/docs), some of the supported languages and frameworks include:

* Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (including React, Angular, Vue.js)
* Backend: Python (including Django, Flask), Ruby (including Rails), Java (including Spring Boot), C# (including .NET Core)
* Mobile: Java/Kotlin (for Android), Swift/Objective-C (for iOS)
* Database: SQL (including MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL (including MongoDB)

If you need a specific language or framework not listed here, you can still use Cursor by configuring your Gaia node to provide LLM services for that language. However, please note that the quality and accuracy of code generation may vary depending on the model's capabilities and your specific use case.

**Bonus Tip**: If you're working with a custom or proprietary programming language, you can also create a custom LLM model using Gaia's [LLM development framework](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/llm-development). This allows you to train a large language model on your specific language and use it with Cursor."

","Q: What is a Gaia node used for in this tutorial?
A: In this tutorial, a Gaia node is used as the LLM (Large Language Model) backend for Cursor AI IDE. Specifically, it provides the API services to power the coding features of Cursor.

A Gaia node acts as a local LLM service that can be accessed via a HTTPS service accessible from the Internet. This allows Cursor to use your own private LLM for coding tasks, which is particularly useful if you want to ensure that your code stays private within your organization or supplement the LLM with a knowledge base specific to your proprietary code repository.

In this tutorial, we are using a public Gaia node (Llama 3.1 8b) as an example, but it's also possible to run your own Gaia node and use your own local LLM service for even more customization and control.

**Bonus tip:** If you're interested in running your own Gaia node, you can check out the [node guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) for a step-by-step guide on how to get started."

","Q: Can you run your own Gaia node or use a public one?
A: You can do both to power Cursor.

To **run your own Gaia node**, you need to follow these steps:

1.  [Download the Gaia Node CLI tool](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaia-node-cli/releases/latest).
2.  Install the downloaded tool using pip (for Python) or conda.
3.  Run `gaia-node start` to set up your node, which will take a few minutes. You can monitor the progress by running `gaia-node logs`.
4.  Once setup is complete, you can use `gaia-node status` to check if everything is working correctly.

To **use a public Gaia node**, you can simply use one of the available nodes on the [Gaia Network](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/nodes). This approach is ideal when you don't want to manage your own infrastructure or prefer not to set up and maintain your own node."

","Q: What type of API services does a Gaia node provide?
A: A Gaia node provides Large Language Model (LLM) API services. It acts as a backend LLM service that can be used by applications such as Cursor AI IDE to generate and review code.

In particular, the Gaia node provides an interface for text-based APIs, allowing it to perform tasks such as:

* Text completion: generating text based on a given prompt or input.
* Question answering: providing answers to questions posed in natural language.
* Code generation: generating code snippets in various programming languages.

By using a Gaia node as the LLM backend, applications like Cursor can leverage the power of AI-driven coding to provide advanced features such as auto-completion, code suggestions, and more.

**Bonus Tip:** When choosing an LLM model for your Gaia node, consider factors such as its size, complexity, and specific use case requirements. For example, if you need a model that excels in natural language processing tasks like question answering, choose a larger model with more parameters (e.g., 8 billion parameters). If you're working on a resource-constrained environment, opt for smaller models with fewer parameters.

**Example:** Suppose you're building a conversational AI chatbot using a Gaia node as the LLM backend. You would use the node's text completion API to generate responses to user queries in natural language. This could involve passing the user input through the API and receiving generated text as output, which can then be further processed or refined by your application.

By leveraging the capabilities of a Gaia node, you can create more sophisticated AI-powered applications that rival those developed using other technologies like OpenAI's GPT-4 or GitHub Copilot."

","Q: Can you leave the API Key field empty when adding models in Dify?
A: According to the provided steps and screenshots, yes, you can leave the API Key field empty when adding models in Dify.

As shown in the screenshot `dify_chat.png` and `dify_embedding.png`, there is an option to add a GaiaNet node as an LLM or embedding model without providing an API Key. The fields for model name and API endpoint are filled with data from the GaiaNet node's web dashboard, but the API Key field remains empty.

This suggests that Dify may be configured to use the GaiaNet node's credentials or authentication methods internally, allowing you to add models without providing additional API Keys.

However, it's essential to note that this might not always be the case, and some specific configurations or restrictions within your account or organization could require a non-empty API Key field. Always check with the relevant documentation or support channels for any specific requirements or guidelines.

**Bonus Tip:** When adding GaiaNet nodes as models in Dify, ensure you're using the correct endpoint URL from the node's web dashboard to avoid connection issues or authentication errors. Additionally, verify that your GaiaNet account and Dify configurations are properly set up to use the chosen model without requiring an API Key.

**Example outside of content:** If you're setting up a new GaiaNet node for use in Dify, consider exploring other LLM models and embedding options available on the platform. You might find that using a different model or combination of models provides improved performance or better results for your specific application."

![Select a GaiaNet node as backend model in Dify](dify_select.png)

![Chat with the GaiaNet Llama3 8b model in Dify](dify_chatbot_ui.png)

","Q: Do most Dify applications require an embedding model for text search?
A: Most Dify applications do require an embedding model to enable text search capabilities. This is because the embedding model allows Dify to convert text into numerical vectors that can be searched in a vector space.

**Why are embedding models necessary?**

Embedding models, like those provided by GaiaNet nodes, perform two key functions:

1. **Text representation**: They transform raw text into numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture the semantic meaning and context of the text.
2. **Similarity calculation**: These embeddings enable Dify to calculate similarities between different texts, which is essential for tasks like search, recommendation, or ranking.

**What happens without an embedding model?**

If you don't use an embedding model in a Dify application, it will likely only be able to perform basic text processing functions, such as tokenization and language detection. You won't be able to take advantage of more advanced features, like text search, clustering, or recommendation.

**When might embedding models not be necessary?**

However, there are some use cases where an embedding model might not be required:

1. **Simple chatbots**: If your Dify application is a simple chatbot that only responds to user input based on pre-defined rules or intents, you might not need an embedding model.
2. **Data analysis**: In certain data analysis scenarios, you might not require text search capabilities and can focus solely on processing and analyzing the raw text data.

In summary, while not all Dify applications require an embedding model, many do rely on these models for advanced text search and processing capabilities.

**Bonus tip:** When selecting a GaiaNet node or configuring your own embedding model in Dify, ensure that the model is optimized for the specific use case and language(s) you're working with. This will help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the text search and processing tasks."

# FlowiseAI tool call

FlowiseAI is a low-code tool for developers to build customized LLM orchestration flows & AI agents. 
You can configure the FlowiseAI tool to use a Gaia node that supports [LLM tool calling](https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge/blob/main/api-server/ToolUse.md).

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL.
In this tutorial, you will need to [set up a public node with tool call support](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/blob/main/mistral-0.3-7b-instruct-tool-call/README.md).

## Start a FlowiseAI server

Follow [the FlowiseAI guide](https://docs.flowiseai.com/getting-started) to install Flowise locally

```
npm install -g flowise
npx flowise start
```

After running successfully, you can open `http://localhost:3000` to check out the Flowise AI tool.

## Build a chatbot for realtime IP lookup

Step 1: Create a new **Chatflow** from the UI.

![](flowise-tool-01.png)

Step 2: On the **Chatflow** canvas, add a node called **ChatLocalAI**.

![](flowise-tool-02.png)

Step 3: Configure the **ChatLocalAI** widget to use the Gaia node with tool call support you have created.

* Base path: `https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1`
* Model name: e.g., `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q5_K_M`

Step 4: Add a node called **Custom Tool** 

Create a function named `get_ip_address_geo_location`. 
The function requires a `string` parameter called `ip`.

The **Tool description** field is the ""prompt"" that tells the LLM when to use this function. In this example,
if the LLM detects that the user is asking about the city or country of an IP address, it will
return a tool call response asking FlowiseAI to perform this function call first.

![](flowise-tool-03.png)

Now you can add JavaScript code for this function. It looks up the location of the input `ip` parameter.

```
const fetch = require(""node-fetch"")
const url = ""http://ipwho.is/""+$ip

try {
  const response = await fetch(url)
  const result = await response.text()
  console.log(result)
  return result
} catch(error) {
  console.error(error)
}
```

![](flowise-tool-04.png)

Step 5: Add a node called **Buffer Memory** to the canvas.

Step 6: Add a node called **Tool Agent**.

Step 7: Connect the nodes.

Connect the **Custom Tool** and **Buffer Memory** nodes to the appropriate connectors on the 
**Tool Agent** node. Connect the **ChatLocalAI** node to the **Custom Tool**.

![](flowise-tool-05.png)

Step 8: Save the **Chatflow**.

## Give it a try

From the FlowiseAI UI, you can open a chat window to chat with the **ChatLocalAI** you just created. Let's
ask a question:

```
What's the location of this address 35.222.115.181
```

The LLM understands that the request is to find a location for an IP address, and sees that we have a function
called `get_ip_address_geo_location` in tools, which has a description that matches this task. 
So, it responses with a JSON message to call this function with
the IP address it extracts from the user query.

This tool calling JSON message is NOT displayed to the user in the chatbot. Instead, the FlowiseAI
**Custom Tool** node captures it and executes the JavaScript code associated with this tool call. The result of
the tool call is then sent back to the LLM together with the original query, 
which is why we need the **Buffer Memory** node BTW, 
and the LLM formulates a human readable response to the original question.

","Summary:
This is a comprehensive guide on how to use the FlowiseAI tool to build a chatbot for real-time IP lookup using a Gaia node with tool call support. Here's a summary of the steps:

**Prerequisites**

1. You need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL.
2. You need to set up a public node with tool call support.

**Step 1: Install FlowiseAI and start the server**

1. Follow the FlowiseAI guide to install it locally using `npm install -g flowise` and `npx flowise start`.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` to access the Flowise AI tool.

**Step 2: Create a new Chatflow**

1. Create a new chat flow from the UI.
2. Add a node called **ChatLocalAI**.
3. Configure the **ChatLocalAI** widget to use the Gaia node with tool call support you created.

**Step 3: Create a custom tool**

1. Add a node called **Custom Tool**.
2. Create a function named `get_ip_address_geo_location` that takes an IP address as input and returns its location.
3. The function uses the `node-fetch` library to make an HTTP request to an IP lookup service.

**Step 4: Connect nodes**

1. Add a node called **Buffer Memory** to store the tool call response.
2. Add a node called **Tool Agent**.
3. Connect the nodes as follows:
	* **Custom Tool** → **Buffer Memory** → **Tool Agent**
	* **ChatLocalAI** → **Custom Tool**

**Step 5: Save and test**

1. Save the chat flow.
2. Open a chat window to interact with the chatbot.
3. Ask a question that triggers the tool call, such as ""What's the location of this address 35.222.115.181"".

The chatbot will respond with the location of the IP address, which is obtained by calling the custom tool and executing its JavaScript code.

Note: This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of Node.js and JavaScript, as well as familiarity with the FlowiseAI UI and Gaia node setup."

# FlowiseAI tool call

FlowiseAI is a low-code tool for developers to build customized LLM orchestration flows & AI agents. 
You can configure the FlowiseAI tool to use a Gaia node that supports [LLM tool calling](https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge/blob/main/api-server/ToolUse.md).

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL.
In this tutorial, you will need to [set up a public node with tool call support](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/blob/main/mistral-0.3-7b-instruct-tool-call/README.md).

## Start a FlowiseAI server

Follow [the FlowiseAI guide](https://docs.flowiseai.com/getting-started) to install Flowise locally

```
npm install -g flowise
npx flowise start
```

After running successfully, you can open `http://localhost:3000` to check out the Flowise AI tool.

## Build a chatbot for realtime IP lookup

Step 1: Create a new **Chatflow** from the UI.

![](flowise-tool-01.png)

Step 2: On the **Chatflow** canvas, add a node called **ChatLocalAI**.

![](flowise-tool-02.png)

Step 3: Configure the **ChatLocalAI** widget to use the Gaia node with tool call support you have created.

* Base path: `https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1`
* Model name: e.g., `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q5_K_M`

Step 4: Add a node called **Custom Tool** 

Create a function named `get_ip_address_geo_location`. 
The function requires a `string` parameter called `ip`.

The **Tool description** field is the ""prompt"" that tells the LLM when to use this function. In this example,
if the LLM detects that the user is asking about the city or country of an IP address, it will
return a tool call response asking FlowiseAI to perform this function call first.

![](flowise-tool-03.png)

Now you can add JavaScript code for this function. It looks up the location of the input `ip` parameter.

```
const fetch = require(""node-fetch"")
const url = ""http://ipwho.is/""+$ip

try {
  const response = await fetch(url)
  const result = await response.text()
  console.log(result)
  return result
} catch(error) {
  console.error(error)
}
```

![](flowise-tool-04.png)

Step 5: Add a node called **Buffer Memory** to the canvas.

Step 6: Add a node called **Tool Agent**.

Step 7: Connect the nodes.

Connect the **Custom Tool** and **Buffer Memory** nodes to the appropriate connectors on the 
**Tool Agent** node. Connect the **ChatLocalAI** node to the **Custom Tool**.

![](flowise-tool-05.png)

Step 8: Save the **Chatflow**.

## Give it a try

From the FlowiseAI UI, you can open a chat window to chat with the **ChatLocalAI** you just created. Let's
ask a question:

```
What's the location of this address 35.222.115.181
```

The LLM understands that the request is to find a location for an IP address, and sees that we have a function
called `get_ip_address_geo_location` in tools, which has a description that matches this task. 
So, it responses with a JSON message to call this function with
the IP address it extracts from the user query.

This tool calling JSON message is NOT displayed to the user in the chatbot. Instead, the FlowiseAI
**Custom Tool** node captures it and executes the JavaScript code associated with this tool call. The result of
the tool call is then sent back to the LLM together with the original query, 
which is why we need the **Buffer Memory** node BTW, 
and the LLM formulates a human readable response to the original question.

![](flowise-tool-06.png)

","Q: 1. What is the name of the tool that enables customized LLM orchestration flows & AI agents?
A: The tool that enables customized LLM orchestration flows & AI agents is called **FlowiseAI**.

Bonus Tip: FlowiseAI is a low-code tool, meaning it requires minimal coding knowledge to build complex AI models and workflows. This makes it an attractive option for developers who want to quickly prototype and deploy AI-powered applications.

Example Use Case: Imagine you're building a chatbot that needs to integrate with multiple third-party APIs to retrieve user information. With FlowiseAI, you can create a customized workflow that orchestrates these API calls using LLMs, making it easier to build robust and efficient chatbots."

Follow [the FlowiseAI guide](https://docs.flowiseai.com/getting-started) to install Flowise locally

```
npm install -g flowise
npx flowise start
```

After running successfully, you can open `http://localhost:3000` to check out the Flowise AI tool.

## Build a chatbot for realtime IP lookup

Step 1: Create a new **Chatflow** from the UI.

![](flowise-tool-01.png)

Step 2: On the **Chatflow** canvas, add a node called **ChatLocalAI**.

![](flowise-tool-02.png)

Step 3: Configure the **ChatLocalAI** widget to use the Gaia node with tool call support you have created.

* Base path: `https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1`
* Model name: e.g., `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q5_K_M`

Step 4: Add a node called **Custom Tool** 

Create a function named `get_ip_address_geo_location`. 
The function requires a `string` parameter called `ip`.

The **Tool description** field is the ""prompt"" that tells the LLM when to use this function. In this example,
if the LLM detects that the user is asking about the city or country of an IP address, it will
return a tool call response asking FlowiseAI to perform this function call first.

![](flowise-tool-03.png)

Now you can add JavaScript code for this function. It looks up the location of the input `ip` parameter.

```
const fetch = require(""node-fetch"")
const url = ""http://ipwho.is/""+$ip

try {
  const response = await fetch(url)
  const result = await response.text()
  console.log(result)
  return result
} catch(error) {
  console.error(error)
}
```

![](flowise-tool-04.png)

Step 5: Add a node called **Buffer Memory** to the canvas.

Step 6: Add a node called **Tool Agent**.

Step 7: Connect the nodes.

Connect the **Custom Tool** and **Buffer Memory** nodes to the appropriate connectors on the 
**Tool Agent** node. Connect the **ChatLocalAI** node to the **Custom Tool**.

![](flowise-tool-05.png)

Step 8: Save the **Chatflow**.

## Give it a try

From the FlowiseAI UI, you can open a chat window to chat with the **ChatLocalAI** you just created. Let's
ask a question:

```
What's the location of this address 35.222.115.181
```

The LLM understands that the request is to find a location for an IP address, and sees that we have a function
called `get_ip_address_geo_location` in tools, which has a description that matches this task. 
So, it responses with a JSON message to call this function with
the IP address it extracts from the user query.

This tool calling JSON message is NOT displayed to the user in the chatbot. Instead, the FlowiseAI
**Custom Tool** node captures it and executes the JavaScript code associated with this tool call. The result of
the tool call is then sent back to the LLM together with the original query, 
which is why we need the **Buffer Memory** node BTW, 
and the LLM formulates a human readable response to the original question.

![](flowise-tool-06.png)

","Q: 7. What base path should be used in the widget configuration for a node that supports LLM tool calling?
A: According to the tutorial, for a node that supports LLM tool calling, you should use the base path `https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1` in the widget configuration.

This is specified in Step 3 of the tutorial: ""Configure the **ChatLocalAI** widget to use the Gaia node with tool call support you have created.""

So, replace `YOUR-NODE-ID` with your actual node ID. This will allow FlowiseAI to interact with the LLM model on the Gaia node.

Example:
```
https://my-node-id.us.gaianet.network/v1
```"

","Q: 9. What is the name of the error object caught by the function if it fails to execute successfully?
A: The error object caught by the function in Step 4 (the `get_ip_address_geo_location` function) is named ""error"".

Here's the code snippet again for reference:

```
try {
  const response = await fetch(url)
  const result = await response.text()
  console.log(result)
  return result
} catch(error) {
  console.error(error)
}
```

In this case, when the `fetch` function fails to execute successfully (for example, if there's a network error or if the URL is invalid), the `error` object will contain information about what went wrong. This can be logged and handled as needed in your application."

1. The `fetch` function is used to send a GET request to the specified URL.
2. The `$ip` variable is concatenated with the base URL ""http://ipwho.is/"" to form the complete URL for the request.
3. The response from the server is expected to be JSON data, which is then parsed by the `response.text()` method into a JavaScript object.

* City
* Region
* Country
* Latitude and Longitude coordinates

This data is then stored in the `result` variable and logged to the console for debugging purposes."

## Build a documents QnA chatbot

FlowiseAI allows you to visually set up all the workflow components for an AI agent. If you're new to FlowiseAI, it's recommended to use a template quick start. In fact, there are lots of templates around OpenAI in the Flowise marketplace. All we need to do is to replace the ChatOpenAI component with the ChatLocalAI component.

Let's take the **Flowise Docs QnA** as an example. You can build a QnA chatbot based on your documents. In this example, we would like to chat with a set of documents in a GitHub repo. The default template was built with OpenAI and we will now change it to use an open-source LLM on a Gaia node. 

### Get the **Flowise Docs QnA** template

![](flowise-01.png)

Click on Marketplaces on the left tab to browse all the templates. The template **Flowise Docs QnA** we will use is the first one.

![](flowise-02.png)

Then, click on Use this template button on the left top corner to open the visual editor.

### Connect the chat model API

You will need to delete the ChatOpenAI component and click the + button to search ChatLocalAI, and then drag the ChatLocalAI to the screen.

![](flowise-03.png)

Then, you will need to input 

* the Gaia node base URL `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` 
* the model name `llama`

Next, connect the ChatLocalAI component with the field `Chat model` in the **Conversational Retrieval QA Chain** component.

### Connect the embedding model API

The default template uses the OpenAI Embeddings component to create embeddings for your documents. We need to replace the **OpenAI Embeddings** component with the **LocalAI Embeddings** component.

* Use the Gaia node base URL `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` in the Base Path field.
* Input the model name `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16` in the Model Name field.

Next, connect the **LocalAI Embeddings** component with the field `embedding` in the **In-Memory Vector Store** component.

### Set up your documents

Then, let's go through the GitHub component to connect the chat application to our documents on GitHub. You will need to put your docs GitHub link into the **Repo Link** field. For example, you can put GaiaNet's docs link: `https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs/tree/main/docs`.

## Give it a try

You can send a question like ""How to install a GaiaNet node"" after saving the current chatflow. 

![](flowise-04.png)

You will get the answer based on the GaiaNet docs, which are more accurate.

## More examples

There are lots of examples on the Flowise marketplace. To build a Flowise agent based on GaiaNet, simply replace the **Chat OpenAI** and **OpenAI Embeddings** component with the GaiaNet base URL.
","Summary:
**FlowiseAI RAG Chat Tutorial**

## More examples

There are lots of examples on the Flowise marketplace. To build a Flowise agent based on GaiaNet, simply replace the **Chat OpenAI** and **OpenAI Embeddings** component with the GaiaNet base URL.
","Q: What needs to be ready to provide LLM services through a public URL?
A: To provide LLM (Large Language Model) services through a public URL, you will need to have the following ready:

1.  **Gaia Node**: You can either run your own Gaia node or use a public node. If you want to run your own node, follow the [Quick Start guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md). Alternatively, if you prefer to use a public node, you can refer to the list of [available nodes](../nodes.md).

2.  **LLM Model**: You need to have an LLM model set up on your Gaia node. This involves selecting and configuring a suitable model for your specific application.

3.  **API Base URL**: The API base URL is the public address through which clients can access your Gaia node's services. Ensure this is properly configured on your node setup or when using a public node.

4.  **Publicly Accessible Network Connection**: Your Gaia node or public node needs to have a publicly accessible network connection, allowing external applications to communicate with it.

5.  **Security and Authentication**: Depending on your use case and requirements, you may need to set up security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to ensure secure communication between clients and your LLM services.

By having these components in place, you can provide LLM services through a public URL for others to utilize.

**Bonus Tip:** Always ensure that your Gaia node or the service provider's infrastructure has sufficient resources (e.g., CPU, memory, and storage) to handle the expected workload, especially if you're planning to offer high-performance LLM services.

For example, if you're using a public node hosted on AWS, you can configure autoscaling rules based on CPU utilization to dynamically scale your instance size up or down according to demand. This approach helps ensure optimal resource utilization and performance while keeping costs in check."

","Q: How do you run your own node to provide LLM services?
A: To run your own node to provide LLM services using GaiaNet, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Get a suitable machine**: You can use a virtual machine (VM) or a dedicated server with sufficient resources (at least 16 GB RAM and a quad-core CPU). Consider the computational requirements of the LLM models you plan to run.
2. **Choose an operating system**: Select a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu or CentOS, which are widely supported by GaiaNet.
3. **Install Docker**: Docker is essential for running LLM containers. Follow the installation instructions for your chosen OS.
4. **Get a GaiaNet node image**: You can obtain the official GaiaNet node image from their repository. This will provide you with a pre-configured container environment for running LLM services.
5. **Configure the node**: Update the `config.json` file within the Docker container to include your desired LLM models, authentication credentials, and other settings as needed.
6. **Start the GaiaNet node**: Use the Docker command `docker run` to launch the container with the pre-configured settings.
7. **Verify the node**: Test the LLM services by sending requests to your node using tools like `curl` or a client library.

Here's an example of how to start a GaiaNet node on Ubuntu:

1. Install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```
2. Pull the GaiaNet node image:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gaianet-ai/node:latest
```
3. Create a configuration file (`config.json`) with your desired settings:
```json
{
  ""llm"": {
    ""models"": [
      {
        ""name"": ""your-latest-model-name"",
        ""url"": ""https://your-latest-model-url.com/v1""
      }
    ]
  },
  ""auth"": {
    ""username"": ""your-username"",
    ""password"": ""your-password""
  }
}
```
4. Start the GaiaNet node:
```bash
docker run -d --name gaianet-node \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/config.json:/config.json \
  ghcr.io/gaianet-ai/node:latest \
  --config /config.json
```
This command will start the GaiaNet node container with the specified configuration and expose port `80` for incoming requests.

**Bonus tip:** Make sure to monitor your node's performance, as it may affect the quality of service. Consider implementing load balancing or autoscaling mechanisms if necessary.

By following these steps, you can create a self-hosted LLM node using GaiaNet, providing reliable and efficient access to large language models for various applications."

Click on Marketplaces on the left tab to browse all the templates. The template **Flowise Docs QnA** we will use is the first one.

![](flowise-02.png)

Then, click on Use this template button on the left top corner to open the visual editor.

### Connect the chat model API

You will need to delete the ChatOpenAI component and click the + button to search ChatLocalAI, and then drag the ChatLocalAI to the screen.

![](flowise-03.png)

Then, you will need to input 

* the Gaia node base URL `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` 
* the model name `llama`

Next, connect the ChatLocalAI component with the field `Chat model` in the **Conversational Retrieval QA Chain** component.

### Connect the embedding model API

The default template uses the OpenAI Embeddings component to create embeddings for your documents. We need to replace the **OpenAI Embeddings** component with the **LocalAI Embeddings** component.

* Use the Gaia node base URL `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` in the Base Path field.
* Input the model name `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16` in the Model Name field.

Next, connect the **LocalAI Embeddings** component with the field `embedding` in the **In-Memory Vector Store** component.

### Set up your documents

Then, let's go through the GitHub component to connect the chat application to our documents on GitHub. You will need to put your docs GitHub link into the **Repo Link** field. For example, you can put GaiaNet's docs link: `https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs/tree/main/docs`.

## Give it a try

You can send a question like ""How to install a GaiaNet node"" after saving the current chatflow. 

![](flowise-04.png)

You will get the answer based on the GaiaNet docs, which are more accurate.

## More examples

There are lots of examples on the Flowise marketplace. To build a Flowise agent based on GaiaNet, simply replace the **Chat OpenAI** and **OpenAI Embeddings** component with the GaiaNet base URL.
","Q: How does the user interact with the template in the visual editor?
A: In the Flowise visual editor, users interact with the template by:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag components from the left-hand sidebar and drop them onto the canvas to add new components to their workflow.
2. **Component Settings**: Once a component is added, users can configure its settings by clicking on it and accessing its properties panel. For example, in the case of the ChatLocalAI component, users need to input the Gaia node base URL `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` and the model name `llama`.
3. **Connecting Components**: Users can connect components together by dragging a connector from one component's output port to another component's input port.
4. **Editing Component Properties**: Users can edit the properties of individual components, such as the GitHub repository link in the GitHub component.

Here's a more detailed example:

Let's say we want to add a new component to our workflow called ""Retrieve Document"". We would:

1. Click on the **+** button in the top-left corner of the canvas to open the component library.
2. Search for "" Retrieve Document"" and click on it to add it to the canvas.
3. Drag a connector from the output port of the previous component (e.g., the ChatLocalAI component) to the input port of the new component (e.g., the Retrieve Document component).
4. Configure the properties of the Retrieve Document component by clicking on it and accessing its properties panel.

By following these steps, users can create a customized workflow based on the template in the visual editor.

**Bonus Tip**: When creating a new component instance, you can also use the ""Copy"" feature to duplicate an existing component's settings. This can save time when setting up multiple components with similar configurations.

**Example Use Case**: Suppose we want to build a chatbot that retrieves documents from a GitHub repository based on user input. We would add a ChatLocalAI component to accept user input, followed by a Retrieve Document component to retrieve the relevant document from the repository."

# A planning agent

The [gpt planner](https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-prompt-engineer/blob/main/gpt_planner.ipynb) is a Python
application that demonstrate the planning capabilities of LLMs. When you run it, it will ask the LLM
to generate multiple action plans for a goal or a query. It will then ask the LLM to compare and select
the best plan, and then rewrite it to answer the user query.

Since the program uses the official OpenAI Python library, we can [easily change it to use a Gaia node](intro.md).

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public node.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |

## Run the agent

First, [load the nodebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mshumer/gpt-prompt-engineer/blob/main/gpt_planner.ipynb).

Edit the code to create an OpenAI client. We will pass in the `base_url` here.

```
client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=""https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1"", api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
```

Next, replace all the `gpt-4o-mini` model name with the `llama` model name in the code. 
Here is an example.

```
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""llama"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant. Use the given plan to create a detailed and high-quality response to the user's query.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": f""User Query: {user_query}\n\nPlan: {best_plan}\n\nGenerate a detailed response based on this plan.""}
    ],
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=2000
)
```

Change the query to your own.

```
user_query = ""How do I debug a TLS connection timeout?""
```

Finally, run the notebook to see the results!
","Summary:
This text appears to be a tutorial on how to use a planning agent with LLM (Large Language Model) services. The planning agent is a Python application that uses the official OpenAI library to generate action plans for a goal or query, compare and select the best plan, and rewrite it to answer the user's query.

Here is a step-by-step summary of the tutorial:

1. **Prerequisites**: To use this tutorial, you need to have:
	* A Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL (you can either run your own node or use a public one).
	* An OpenAI API key.
2. **Run the agent**: 
	* Load the `gpt_planner.ipynb` notebook in colab.
	* Edit the code to create an OpenAI client with the Gaia node's URL and your OpenAI API key.
	* Replace all instances of the model name `gpt-4o-mini` with `llama`.
3. **Set up the query**: 
	* Define a user query, such as ""How do I debug a TLS connection timeout?"".
4. **Run the notebook**: Run the notebook to see the results.

The tutorial assumes that you have prior knowledge of LLM services and Python programming. The `gpt_planner` application is designed to demonstrate the planning capabilities of LLMs and can be easily adapted for other tasks by modifying the code and using different models or prompts."

","Q: Is the OpenAI Python library being used to interface with a LLM service?
A: Yes, the OpenAI Python library is being used to interface with a Large Language Model (LLM) service. According to the text, when you run the [gpt planner](https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-prompt-engineer/blob/main/gpt_planner.ipynb), it will ask the LLM to generate multiple action plans for a goal or a query using the OpenAI client.

The OpenAI client is used to interact with the LLM service provided by Gaia, which is a platform that offers LLM services through public URLs. The `base_url` parameter in the code snippet points to the API endpoint URL of the LLM service.

Here's a relevant example of how the OpenAI Python library can be used to interface with an LLM service:

```python
from openai import api_key, Client

client = Client(api_key=api_key)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""text-davinci-002"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Write a short story about a cat who learns to fly.""}
    ],
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=2000
)

print(response)
```

In this example, the OpenAI Python library is used to send a request to the LLM service to generate a short story about a cat who learns to fly.

**Bonus Tip**: When using the OpenAI Python library to interface with an LLM service, make sure to handle errors and exceptions properly. You can use try-except blocks to catch any errors that may occur during the API request. For example:

```python
try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=""text-davinci-002"",
        messages=[
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Write a short story about a cat who learns to fly.""}
        ],
        temperature=0.5,
        max_tokens=2000
    )
except openai.error.APIError as e:
    print(f""An error occurred: {e}"")

","Q: What value should be passed for `base_url` when creating an OpenAI client?
A: Based on the context, when creating an OpenAI client, you should pass the URL of your Gaia node that provides LLM services. In this case, the value for `base_url` would be:

```

**Bonus Tip:** When passing the `base_url` parameter, make sure to include the full URL (including the scheme and path) so that OpenAI knows how to connect to the Gaia node.

Example outside of the content:

Let's say you have a custom node running at `https://your-node.com/v1`. In this case, you would pass the following value for `base_url` when creating an OpenAI client:

Note: The tutorial originally uses the OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model but then updates the code to use the Llama model instead.

**Bonus Tip:** It's essential to keep track of the model names and versions used, as different models have varying strengths and weaknesses. When comparing models or using different models for a task, it's crucial to evaluate their performance on your specific use case.

Example outside of this content: Another popular language model is **Bart** (Bidirectional and Autoregressive Transformers), which is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation and text summarization."

A: The `user_query` variable gets assigned a new value in the following cell:

```
user_query = ""How do I debug a TLS connection timeout?""
```

This is located at the very end of the code snippet provided.

**Bonus Tip:** When modifying or updating variables, it's a good practice to assign new values using `=` operator. In this case, we are assigning a string value to the variable `user_query`. The code is straightforward and easy to read.

Example outside of the content: Suppose you have a function that takes a name as an argument and greets the person. You can update the `name` variable inside the function like this:

```python
def greet(name):
    name = ""John""  # assigning new value to name variable
    print(f""Hello, {name}!"")

greet(""Jane"")  # output: Hello, Jane! (but the internal name is John)
```"

# A planning agent

The [gpt planner](https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-prompt-engineer/blob/main/gpt_planner.ipynb) is a Python
application that demonstrate the planning capabilities of LLMs. When you run it, it will ask the LLM
to generate multiple action plans for a goal or a query. It will then ask the LLM to compare and select
the best plan, and then rewrite it to answer the user query.

Since the program uses the official OpenAI Python library, we can [easily change it to use a Gaia node](intro.md).

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public node.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |

## Run the agent

First, [load the nodebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mshumer/gpt-prompt-engineer/blob/main/gpt_planner.ipynb).

Edit the code to create an OpenAI client. We will pass in the `base_url` here.

```
client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=""https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1"", api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
```

Next, replace all the `gpt-4o-mini` model name with the `llama` model name in the code. 
Here is an example.

```
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""llama"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant. Use the given plan to create a detailed and high-quality response to the user's query.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": f""User Query: {user_query}\n\nPlan: {best_plan}\n\nGenerate a detailed response based on this plan.""}
    ],
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=2000
)
```

Change the query to your own.

```
user_query = ""How do I debug a TLS connection timeout?""
```

Finally, run the notebook to see the results!
","Q: What is the temperature set to when generating a completion using the chat API?
A: When generating a completion using the OpenAI chat API, the `temperature` parameter is set to 0.5 by default. This means that the language model will be slightly more creative and less deterministic in its responses.

**What does temperature mean?**

In the context of large language models like the ones used by OpenAI, ""temperature"" is a measure of how much the model's output should diverge from the most likely next word or phrase. A higher temperature means that the model will be more likely to generate unusual and unexpected responses.

**Why is temperature set to 0.5?**

In this particular case, the temperature is set to 0.5, which is a relatively moderate value. This suggests that the developers want the model to generate responses that are still coherent and relevant, but also not too generic or boring. A temperature of 0.5 will encourage the model to explore different possibilities and nuances in its response, making it more engaging and informative.

**Bonus tip**

When experimenting with different temperatures, keep an eye on how the output changes. If you're finding that the responses are becoming too unpredictable or nonsensical, you may want to lower the temperature to get more reliable results. On the other hand, if you want to encourage the model to come up with more innovative and outside-the-box ideas, try increasing the temperature!"

```
user_query = ""How do I debug a TLS connection timeout?""
```

Finally, run the notebook to see the results!
","Q: How many tokens can be returned per completion request in this code snippet?
A: According to the OpenAI documentation, the `max_tokens` parameter in the `create()` method of the `completions.create()` function can have a value up to 4096. This means that, by default, the maximum number of tokens that can be returned per completion request in this code snippet is 4096.

However, it's worth noting that the actual limit may be lower for certain models or configurations. The `max_tokens` parameter can also be used to specify a lower value if needed.

Here's an example with the default max_tokens value:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""llama"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant. Use the given plan to create a detailed and high-quality response to the user's query.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": f""User Query: {user_query}\n\nPlan: {best_plan}\n\nGenerate a detailed response based on this plan.""}
    ],
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=4096
)
```

**Bonus Tip:** When working with long text generation, it's often helpful to use the `stream` parameter to retrieve the output in chunks, rather than all at once. This can be especially useful when dealing with models that have a high memory footprint or when working with limited network resources."

# OpenAI ecosystem apps

Since each GaiaNet node provides an OpenAI-compatible API service, it can be a drop-in replacement for
OpenAI in almost all LLM applications and frameworks. Checkout the articles in this section for instructions 
and examples for how to use GaiaNet in popular LLM apps.

## The OpenAI Python library

You can install the [official OpenAI Python library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) as follows.

```
pip install openai
```

When you create an OpenAI client using the library, you can pass in the API endpoint point as the `base_url`.
Remember to append the `/v1` after the host name. You can find a list of publc nodes [here](../nodes.md).

```
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=""https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1"", api_key="""")
```

Alternatively, you could set an environment variable at the OS level.

```
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1
```

Then, when you make API calls from the `client`, make sure that the `model` is set to the model name
available on your node.

```
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a strategic reasoner.""},
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What is the purpose of life?""}
        ],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=500
    ]
)
```

That's it! You can now take any application built with the official OpenAI Python library and use a Gaia node
as its backend!

## The OpenAI Node API library

You can install the OpenAI Node library which provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript as follows:

```
npm install openai
```

Import it into your project as:
```
// Example usage in Node.js
const OpenAI = require('openai');
```

Create an OpenAI client with a custom base URL. Remember to append the `/v1` after the host name.

```
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1',
  apiKey: '' // Leave this empty when using Gaia
});
```

Alternatively, you can set an environment variable using `dotenv` in Node.
```
process.env.OPENAI_API_BASE = 'https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1';
```

Then, when you make API calls from the `client`, make sure that the `model` is set to the model name
available on your node.

```
async function callOpenAI() {
  try {
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: ""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
      messages: [
        { role: ""system"", content: ""You are a strategic reasoner."" },
        { role: ""user"", content: ""What is the purpose of life?"" }
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 500
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

//Usage
callOpenAI();
```","Summary:
This is a guide on how to use the OpenAI ecosystem apps with GaiaNet, a cloud-based API service that provides an OpenAI-compatible interface.

**Overview**

GaiaNet allows users to replace OpenAI in various Large Language Model (LLM) applications and frameworks. The guide covers how to integrate GaiaNet into popular LLM apps using the OpenAI Python library and Node.js API library.

**Installing the OpenAI Python Library**

To start, install the official OpenAI Python library using pip:
```
pip install openai
```
**Creating an OpenAI Client with GaiaNet**

When creating an OpenAI client using the library, you need to specify the API endpoint URL, which includes the `/v1` path. You can find a list of public nodes on the GaiaNet documentation.
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=""https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1"", api_key="""")
```
Alternatively, you can set an environment variable `OPENAI_API_BASE` with the endpoint URL.

**Making API Calls**

When making API calls from the client, ensure that the `model` parameter is set to the model name available on your node. The example below demonstrates how to make a chat completion request:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a strategic reasoner.""},
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What is the purpose of life?""}
        ],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=500
    ]
)
```
**Installing and Using the OpenAI Node API Library**

For Node.js applications, install the `openai` library:
```bash
npm install openai
```
Import it into your project and create an OpenAI client with a custom base URL.
```javascript
const OpenAI = require('openai');

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1',
  apiKey: '' // Leave this empty when using Gaia
});
```
Alternatively, set an environment variable `OPENAI_API_BASE` using `dotenv`.

When making API calls from the client, ensure that the `model` parameter is set to the model name available on your node. The example below demonstrates how to make a chat completion request:
```javascript
async function callOpenAI() {
  try {
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: ""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
      messages: [
        { role: ""system"", content: ""You are a strategic reasoner."" },
        { role: ""user"", content: ""What is the purpose of life?"" }
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 500
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

A: According to the given context, the OpenAI Node API library supports **TypeScript and JavaScript** for convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from the client-side.

Additionally, bonus tip: If you are using a Node.js environment, it is recommended to use `dotenv` package to load your environment variables from a `.env` file. This makes it easy to keep sensitive information such as API keys secure and organized.

Example:
```javascript
const dotenv = require('dotenv');

dotenv.config();

process.env.OPENAI_API_BASE = 'https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1';

```
Alternatively, you could set an environment variable at the OS level to avoid hardcoding the base URL.

This allows GaiaNet nodes to seamlessly integrate with existing LLM applications and frameworks that rely on OpenAI's API, without requiring any significant modifications or updates.

**Bonus Tip:** When using a GaiaNet node as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI, make sure to check the available model names on your node by visiting the [GaiaNet nodes page](../nodes.md). This will ensure you're using a compatible model name when making API calls."

    ]
)
```

That's it! You can now take any application built with the official OpenAI Python library and use a Gaia node
as its backend!

## The OpenAI Node API library

You can install the OpenAI Node library which provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript as follows:

```
npm install openai
```

Import it into your project as:
```
// Example usage in Node.js
const OpenAI = require('openai');
```

Create an OpenAI client with a custom base URL. Remember to append the `/v1` after the host name.

```
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1',
  apiKey: '' // Leave this empty when using Gaia
});
```

Alternatively, you can set an environment variable using `dotenv` in Node.
```
process.env.OPENAI_API_BASE = 'https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1';
```

Then, when you make API calls from the `client`, make sure that the `model` is set to the model name
available on your node.

```
async function callOpenAI() {
  try {
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: ""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
      messages: [
        { role: ""system"", content: ""You are a strategic reasoner."" },
        { role: ""user"", content: ""What is the purpose of life?"" }
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 500
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

//Usage
callOpenAI();
```","Q: How do you install the official OpenAI Python library?
A: To install the official OpenAI Python library, you can use pip, which is the package installer for Python. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install openai
```

This will download and install the latest version of the OpenAI library from the PyPI (Python Package Index) repository.

Alternatively, if you have both Python 2.x and Python 3.x installed on your system, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`:

```
pip3 install openai
```

After installation, you can verify that the library is properly installed by importing it in a Python script or interactive shell:
```python
import openai

print(openai.__version__)
```

This should print out the version number of the OpenAI library.

**Bonus Tip:** If you are using a virtual environment (e.g. `venv`), make sure to activate the environment before installing packages, and then deactivate it when you're done:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install package
pip install openai

# Deactivate virtual environment
deactivate
```
This way, you can keep your dependencies isolated within a specific project or workspace."

# OpenAI ecosystem apps

Since each GaiaNet node provides an OpenAI-compatible API service, it can be a drop-in replacement for
OpenAI in almost all LLM applications and frameworks. Checkout the articles in this section for instructions 
and examples for how to use GaiaNet in popular LLM apps.

## The OpenAI Python library

You can install the [official OpenAI Python library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) as follows.

```
pip install openai
```

When you create an OpenAI client using the library, you can pass in the API endpoint point as the `base_url`.
Remember to append the `/v1` after the host name. You can find a list of publc nodes [here](../nodes.md).

```
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=""https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1"", api_key="""")
```

Alternatively, you could set an environment variable at the OS level.

```
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1
```

Then, when you make API calls from the `client`, make sure that the `model` is set to the model name
available on your node.

```

}

//Usage
callOpenAI();
```","Q: Do you need to append the `/v1` after the host name when creating an OpenAI client using the library?
A: Yes, according to the documentation provided in the content, you should append `/v1` after the host name when creating an OpenAI client using the library. This is a requirement for making API calls.

Here's the correct code snippet:

```python
client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=""https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1"", api_key="""")
```

or

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network/v1
```

However, it's worth noting that if you're using the official OpenAI API, the base URL should be `https://api.openai.com/v1` without any modifications. If you're trying to use a Gaia node as mentioned in the context, appending `/v1` after the host name seems to be a necessary step.

**Bonus Tip**: Make sure that you replace `YOUR-NODE-ID.us.gaianet.network` with your actual Gaia node ID and region."

```","Q: What is the purpose of setting an environment variable at the OS level using the `OPENAI_API_BASE` variable?
A: Setting an environment variable at the OS level using `OPENAI_API_BASE` is a good practice for several reasons:

1. **Decoupling**: By setting an environment variable, you can decouple your application's configuration from its code. This makes it easier to switch between different OpenAI API endpoints or nodes without having to modify your code.
2. **Portability**: Environment variables are easily portable across different environments and systems. You can set the `OPENAI_API_BASE` variable on your local machine, in a CI/CD pipeline, or even on a production server, without having to change any code.
3. **Reusability**: By using an environment variable, you can reuse the same configuration across multiple applications or services that need to interact with the OpenAI API.
4. **Consistency**: Environment variables can help maintain consistency in your application's configuration. You can ensure that all instances of your application use the same OpenAI API endpoint without having to remember which one to use.

In the context of the GaiaNet nodes, setting `OPENAI_API_BASE` makes it easy to switch between different nodes or test environments without modifying your code. You simply need to update the environment variable with the new node's URL, and your application will automatically use it.

**Bonus Tip**: When using environment variables in your code, consider using a library like `dotenv` to load them from a `.env` file. This makes it easier to manage sensitive configuration values, such as API keys or credentials, without hardcoding them into your code."

A: Yes, you can set a specific temperature and max tokens in the API call from the client using the `client.chat.completions.create()` method.

Here is an example of how to do it:

```
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a strategic reasoner.""},

        ],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=500
)
```

In this example, we set the `temperature` to 0.7, which means that the model will generate responses with a moderate level of randomness and creativity.

We also set `max_tokens` to 500, which is the maximum number of tokens (i.e., characters) that the model can use in its response.

You can adjust these parameters as needed to achieve the desired balance between diversity and coherence in the generated responses.

**Bonus tip**: Keep in mind that increasing the temperature will generally lead to more creative but also less coherent responses, while decreasing it will result in more factual but less novel outputs."

","Q: What is LlamaCoder?
A: LlamaCoder is an open-source tool designed to generate small apps with a single prompt. It leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to help users quickly create and enhance React applications.

Here are some key features of LlamaCoder:

1. **LLM-based app generation**: LlamaCoder uses LLMs to generate code for small apps based on user input, which can be in the form of a prompt.
2. **React application support**: The tool is specifically designed to work with React applications, making it easy to create and enhance React-based projects.
3. **Single prompt, multiple possibilities**: With LlamaCoder, users can input a single prompt and receive multiple possible code outputs based on different LLM models or parameters.

Overall, LlamaCoder aims to streamline the process of creating small apps by leveraging the power of LLMs and making it more accessible to developers and non-developers alike.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're interested in exploring other tools that use LLMs for code generation, be sure to check out CodeGen or Snack. Both tools offer similar functionality to LlamaCoder, but with some unique features and use cases.

Example: Imagine you want to create a simple React app that displays a list of items fetched from an API. With LlamaCoder, you could input a prompt like ""Create a React app that fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API"" and receive multiple possible code outputs based on different LLM models or parameters. This can save you time and effort compared to writing the code from scratch!"

","Q: What kind of applications can LlamaCoder generate?
A: LlamaCoder is an open-source tool designed to generate small apps with a single prompt, leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) to help you quickly create and enhance React applications. This means that LlamaCoder can generate various types of applications using React as the front-end framework.

Some examples of the types of applications that LlamaCoder can generate include:

1.  **To-Do List Apps**: With a single prompt, LlamaCoder can create a fully functional To-Do list app with features like adding items, checking off completed tasks, and editing existing tasks.
2.  **Weather Apps**: LlamaCoder can generate an app that displays the current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific location based on user input.
3.  **Quiz Games**: Using LlamaCoder, you can create a simple quiz game with multiple choice questions and keep track of the user's score.
4.  **Personal Finance Trackers**: LlamaCoder can generate an app to help users manage their expenses by tracking income and expenses, setting budgets, and providing insights on spending habits.
5.  **Simple Chatbots**: With LlamaCoder, you can create a basic chatbot that responds to user queries using predefined answers or AI-generated responses.

When generating these applications, LlamaCoder uses the LLM to understand the prompt and generate the necessary code in React. This process is fast and efficient, allowing developers to quickly prototype ideas without requiring extensive coding knowledge.

**Bonus Tip:** To get the most out of LlamaCoder, it's essential to craft clear and specific prompts that accurately convey your requirements. The more precise you are with your prompt, the better LlamaCoder can generate code that meets your needs.

For example, if you want to create a To-Do list app, your prompt could be: ""Create a React-based To-Do list app with features like adding items, checking off completed tasks, and editing existing tasks.""

By providing clear prompts, you can save time and effort in the development process while still achieving high-quality results."

# LlamaCoder 

LlamaCoder is an open-source tool designed to generate small apps with a single prompt. It leverages LLM to help you quickly create and enhance React applications.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public Llama3 node.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |
| API KEY | gaia |

## Run the agent

First, we will need to get the source code of the forked LlamaTutor

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llamacoder.git
cd llamacoder
```

Next, configure the `.env` file.

```
cp .example.env .env
```

You will need to configure three parameters here.

* LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL: URL for the LLM API base URL.
* LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME: Name of the model to be used.
* LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY: API key for accessing the LLM services.

For example, you can use the following `.env` setting.

```
LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL=https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1
LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME=llama
LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY=GaiaNet
```

Then, we will need to install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Next, let's run the application locally.

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and start to build your React app.

![](llamacoder.png)
","Q: Does LlamaCoder require a Gaia node to function?
A: Yes, LlamaCoder requires a Gaia node to function. It leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) services provided by the Gaia network through its public URL. Specifically, it needs a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL.

As per the documentation, you can either run your own node or use a public node for accessing LLM services. The tutorial suggests using a public Llama3 node for this purpose.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |
| API KEY | gaia |

The .env file also needs to be configured with the correct parameters, including the LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL, which is the URL for the LLM API base URL.

For example, you can use the following .env setting:

```
LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL=https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1
LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME=llama
LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY=GaiaNet
```

This setup is necessary because LlamaCoder relies on the Gaia node for accessing and utilizing the LLM services.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're planning to use a public node, make sure to check its current status and any potential limitations or restrictions before proceeding."

","Q: Can you run your own Gaia node with LlamaCoder?
A: Yes, you can run your own Gaia node with LlamaCoder. In fact, running your own node is one of the recommended ways to use LlamaCoder, as it gives you full control over your data and allows for more customization.

To run a Gaia node, you will need to follow these general steps:

1. **Download the Gaia Node Software**: You can download the latest version of the Gaia node software from the official Gaia website.
2. **Install Dependencies**: You may need to install additional dependencies such as Docker or container runtime environments, depending on your operating system and setup.
3. **Configure Your Node**: Configure your node settings, including setting up a username, password, and other parameters according to your needs.
4. **Start Your Node**: Start your node by running the command to start it.

Here is an example of how to run a Gaia node using Docker:
```
# Create a new directory for your node
mkdir gaianode

# Navigate into the directory
cd gaianode

# Clone the Gaia repository
git clone https://github.com/GaiaNode/gaiad.git

# Change into the gaiad directory
cd gaiad

# Build and start the Docker container
docker build -t gaiad .
docker run -it --name gaiad-container gaiad /gaiad/run_node
```

3. **Verify the installation**: After installing the packages, you can verify that they were installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
pip freeze
```
   This will list all the packages installed in your Python environment.

4. **Check for any version conflicts**: If you have multiple packages with the same name but different versions, you may need to specify the exact version of each package required by LlamaEdgeBook.

**Bonus Tip:** To avoid installing unnecessary packages, consider using a virtual environment like `conda` or `virtualenv` to isolate your project's dependencies. This way, you can create a separate environment for your project and install only the necessary packages without affecting your global Python environment.

Example:

Suppose you're working on a project that requires both TensorFlow 2.x and PyTorch 1.9.x. You can create two separate virtual environments:
```bash
conda create --name tf-env tensorflow-gpu==2.5.0 python=3.8
conda activate tf-env

conda create --name torch-env pytorch torchvision cpu -c pytorch torchvision=1.9.0a0+cu101 -c conda-forge python=3.9
conda activate torch-env
```
Now you can install the required packages for each project without worrying about version conflicts or polluting your global Python environment.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that LlamaEdgeBook has all necessary packages installed, and you'll be able to run it smoothly and efficiently."

","Q: What should you export to configure a GaiaNet node as the LLM backend?
A: To configure a GaiaNet node as the LLM backend in LlamaEdgeBook, you need to export three environment variables. These are:

1. `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
2. `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`
3. `OPENAI_API_KEY`

You should set these variables as follows:

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1""
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=""gemma"" 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET"" 
```

**Bonus Tip:** If you don't know the model name of the GaiaNet node, you can retrieve the model information using:

```bash
curl -X POST https://0x57b00e4f3d040e28dc8aabdbe201212e5fb60ebc.us.gaianet.network/v1/models
```

This will help you find the correct `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` for your GaiaNet node."

# LlamaCloud

LlamaParse is an API created by LlamaIndex to efficiently parse and represent files for efficient retrieval and context augmentation using LlamaIndex frameworks. LlamaParse can support different kinds of files, like pdf, doc, .ppt, and other formats.

You can configure LlamaParse to use the GaiaNet node as the LLM backend, hence you can create a RAG application based on your PDF files locally.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use public nodes to power the Continue plugin.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1 | gemma |
| Embedding | https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1 | nomic-embed |

## Steps

We will use an open-sourced GitHub repo, called `llamaparse-integration`,  to make LlamaPase easy to use.  The `llamaparse-integration` application supports

* Multiple file formats, like `.pdf` and `.doc`,
* Multiple files

We will need to get the source code in your terminal first. 

```
git clone https://github.com/alabulei1/llamaparse-integration.git
cd llamaparse-integration
```

Next, install the required mode packages.

```
npm install llamaindex
npm install dotenv
```

Start a Qdant instance. The Qdrant instance is to store the embeddings.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

Then, we will need to set up the LLM  model settings. We can configure the model setting in the `.env` file. 

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1/
OPENAI_API_KEY=gaianet
LLAMAEDGE_CHAT_MODEL=gemma
LLAMAEDGE_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic
LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=Your_Own_KEY
FILE_PATH=
FILE_DIR=./pdf_dir
COLLECTION_NAME=default
QDRANT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6333
SAVE_MARKDOWN_PATH=output.md
```

Here are some notes about the `.env` setting:

* You can get the LlamaCloud key from https://cloud.llamaindex.ai
* You may need to make changes according to your model setting and file path.
* If you put your file name in the `FILE_PATH=`, the program will build a RAG application with this single pdf file.
* If the `FILE_PATH=` is empty, the program will build a RAG application with the files under the `FILE_DIR=./pdf_dir`. You can include multiple files in the folder. 

Next, we can run the program to build an RAG application based on the PDF file

```
npx tsx pdfRender.ts
```

After it runs successfully, you can send a query via the command line.

![](llamaparse-01.png)

","Summary:
Here is a comprehensive summary of the text:

**LlamaCloud Overview**

LlamaCloud is an API created by LlamaIndex that efficiently parses and represents files for retrieval and context augmentation. It supports various file formats, such as PDF, DOC, PPT, and more.

**Prerequisites**

To use LlamaParse, you need a Gaia node configured to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can either run your own node or use a public node. The tutorial will use public nodes for powering the Continue plugin.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

The guide is based on an open-sourced GitHub repository called `llamaparse-integration`. This application supports multiple file formats and multiple files.

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the `llamaparse-integration` repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Required Packages**: Install `llamaindex` and `dotenv` packages using npm.
3. **Start a Qdant Instance**: Start a Qdrant instance in Docker to store embeddings. This involves creating two directories for storage and snapshots, and running the Docker container with specific flags.
4. **Set up LLM Model Settings**: Configure the model settings in the `.env` file by providing information such as the GaiaNet node URL, API key, and Qdrant instance URL.
5. **Build a RAG Application**: Run `npx tsx pdfRender.ts` to build an RAG application based on the PDF file or folder specified in the `.env` file.

**Additional Notes**

* You can obtain the LlamaCloud key from https://cloud.llamaindex.ai.
* Make sure to adjust the model settings and file paths according to your specific use case."

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use public nodes to power the Continue plugin.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1 | gemma |
| Embedding | https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1 | nomic-embed |

## Steps

We will use an open-sourced GitHub repo, called `llamaparse-integration`,  to make LlamaPase easy to use.  The `llamaparse-integration` application supports

* Multiple file formats, like `.pdf` and `.doc`,
* Multiple files

We will need to get the source code in your terminal first. 

```
git clone https://github.com/alabulei1/llamaparse-integration.git
cd llamaparse-integration
```

Next, install the required mode packages.

```
npm install llamaindex
npm install dotenv
```

Start a Qdant instance. The Qdrant instance is to store the embeddings.

```
mkdir qdrant_storage
mkdir qdrant_snapshots

nohup docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_snapshots:/qdrant/snapshots:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

Then, we will need to set up the LLM  model settings. We can configure the model setting in the `.env` file. 

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1/
OPENAI_API_KEY=gaianet
LLAMAEDGE_CHAT_MODEL=gemma
LLAMAEDGE_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic
LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=Your_Own_KEY
FILE_PATH=
FILE_DIR=./pdf_dir
COLLECTION_NAME=default
QDRANT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6333
SAVE_MARKDOWN_PATH=output.md
```

Here are some notes about the `.env` setting:

* You can get the LlamaCloud key from https://cloud.llamaindex.ai
* You may need to make changes according to your model setting and file path.
* If you put your file name in the `FILE_PATH=`, the program will build a RAG application with this single pdf file.
* If the `FILE_PATH=` is empty, the program will build a RAG application with the files under the `FILE_DIR=./pdf_dir`. You can include multiple files in the folder. 

Next, we can run the program to build an RAG application based on the PDF file

```
npx tsx pdfRender.ts
```

After it runs successfully, you can send a query via the command line.

","Q: What is the URL for a public node to provide LLM services?
A: According to the provided context, a public node URL for providing LLM services is:

* Chat: `https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1`
* Embedding: `https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1`

Note that these URLs are specific to the GaiaNet node and might not be applicable to other public nodes. 

Bonus tip: When using a public node, make sure to check if it's available and working correctly by testing its API endpoints with a tool like `curl` or Postman before integrating it into your application.

Example outside of the content:
Suppose you're using a Python script to interact with the GaiaNet node. You can use the `requests` library to send a request to the chat endpoint:

```python
import requests

url = ""https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v1""
response = requests.post(url, json={""model"": ""gemma"", ""prompt"": ""Hello World""})

if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
```

This script sends a POST request to the GaiaNet node with a prompt ""Hello World"" and prints the response if it's successful."

","Q: What is the command to install the required mode packages?
A: According to the tutorial, the command to install the required mode packages is:

```bash
npm install llamaindex
npm install dotenv
```

This will install `llamaindex` and `dotenv`, which are necessary for the LlamaParse integration.

**Bonus Tip:** When running npm commands, it's a good practice to use `--save` or `--save-dev` flags to save the package dependencies in your project's `package.json` file. For example:

```bash
npm install llamaindex --save
npm install dotenv --save-dev
```

This will ensure that the packages are properly recorded in your project's dependency list."

","Q: What is the purpose of starting a Qdant instance?
A: In this context, a Qdrant instance is started to store embeddings generated by the LlamaIndex LLM model. An embedding is a high-dimensional vector representation of a piece of text or an image that can be used for efficient similarity searches.

By storing these embeddings in a dedicated database like Qdrant, the application can quickly and efficiently search for similar content when receiving user queries. This is particularly useful when building a Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) model, such as the one created by LlamaParse.

Qdrant serves several purposes here:

1.  **Efficient Embedding Storage**: Qdrant provides an optimized way to store and retrieve embeddings, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
2.  **Similarity Searches**: It allows for fast similarity searches between different embeddings, which is crucial in a RAG model for finding relevant content based on user queries.
3.  **Scalability**: By storing embeddings separately from the application code, Qdrant enables the application to scale more easily, as it can handle large volumes of data and complex search queries.

In this tutorial, starting a Qdant instance is necessary to create a fully functional RAG model that leverages the capabilities of LlamaIndex and efficiently searches for relevant content."

# LlamaTutor

The [LlamaTutor](https://github.com/Nutlope/llamatutor) is a TypeScript
application using Llama 3.1 to act as an open-source AI personal tutor. When you run it, it will ask the LLM
to search on the web based on your inquiry topic and then generate content for you to learn.

The program didn't use the official OpenAI library, we can use the forked one that supports [using a Gaia node](intro.md) as the LLM backend.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [Run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [Use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public Llama3 node.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |
| API KEY | gaia |

## Run the agent

First, we will need to get the source code of the forked LlamaTutor

```
git clone https://github.com/JYC0413/llamatutor.git
cd llamatutor
```

Next, configure the `.env` file.

```
cp .example.env .env
```

You will need to configure four parameters here.

* SERPER_API_KEY: The [serper API key](https://serper.dev/) for searching content online. You can also use BING_API_KEY here.
* LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL: URL for the LLM API base URL.
* LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME: Name of the model to be used.
* LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY: API key for accessing the LLM services.

Then, we will need to install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Next, let's run the application locally.

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and start to learn.

![](llamatutor-01.png)
","Summary:
This is a tutorial on how to use the LlamaTutor, an open-source AI personal tutor built with TypeScript and Llama 3.1.

**What is LlamaTutor?**

LlamaTutor is a TypeScript application that uses Llama 3.1 as its backend to provide AI-powered learning assistance. When you run it, it will ask the LLM (Large Language Model) to search on the web based on your topic of interest and generate content for you to learn.

**Prerequisites**

# LlamaTutor

The [LlamaTutor](https://github.com/Nutlope/llamatutor) is a TypeScript
application using Llama 3.1 to act as an open-source AI personal tutor. When you run it, it will ask the LLM
to search on the web based on your inquiry topic and then generate content for you to learn.

The program didn't use the official OpenAI library, we can use the forked one that supports [using a Gaia node](intro.md) as the LLM backend.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [Run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [Use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public Llama3 node.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |
| API KEY | gaia |

## Run the agent

First, we will need to get the source code of the forked LlamaTutor

```
git clone https://github.com/JYC0413/llamatutor.git
cd llamatutor
```

Next, configure the `.env` file.

```
cp .example.env .env
```

You will need to configure four parameters here.

* SERPER_API_KEY: The [serper API key](https://serper.dev/) for searching content online. You can also use BING_API_KEY here.
* LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL: URL for the LLM API base URL.
* LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME: Name of the model to be used.
* LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY: API key for accessing the LLM services.

Then, we will need to install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Next, let's run the application locally.

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and start to learn.

![](llamatutor-01.png)
","Q: What programming language is the application using?
A: The application is using **TypeScript**. 

**Bonus Tip:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to improve the development experience. If you are not familiar with TypeScript, it's worth learning as it can help catch errors earlier in the development process and improve code maintainability.

For example, let's say we have a function `greet` that takes a name as an argument:
```typescript
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```
In this example, TypeScript is telling us that the `greet` function takes a `string` argument and returns no value (`void`). This can help catch errors if we try to pass in an incorrect type of argument."

","Q: Is Llama 3.1 being used as the AI model?
A: According to the context, yes, Llama 3.1 is being used as the AI model in the LlamaTutor application. It is stated that when you run the LlamaTutor, it will ask the LLM (Large Language Model) to search on the web based on your inquiry topic and then generate content for you to learn using the Llama 3.1 model.

**Bonus Tip:** The Llama 3.1 model is a highly advanced language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet. Its ability to generate human-like responses makes it an excellent tool for educational purposes, such as the LlamaTutor application.

For example, if you were to use the LlamaTutor to learn about a topic like quantum physics, the Llama 3.1 model could provide you with in-depth explanations and examples of complex concepts, making it easier to understand the subject matter."

![](llamatutor-01.png)
","Q: Must a Gaia node be ready to provide LLM services through a public URL?
A: No, a Gaia node does not necessarily need to be ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. In fact, the documentation for [LlamaTutor](https://github.com/Nutlope/llamatutor) mentions that you can either run your own node or use a public node.

If you choose to run your own node, you will need to set it up and make sure it's accessible from the LlamaTutor application. This would require configuring the node to expose its API endpoint and ensuring that it's properly secured.

On the other hand, if you decide to use a public node, you can simply use one of the nodes listed in the [Gaia nodes documentation](https://docs.gaianet.network/nodes) without having to set up your own node. This approach requires no additional configuration or maintenance on your part.

So, while a Gaia node is required for LlamaTutor to function, it doesn't necessarily need to be public-facing.

**Bonus Tip:** If you do decide to run your own Gaia node, make sure to follow the best practices outlined in the [Gaianet security guide](https://docs.gaianet.network/security) to ensure the security and integrity of your node."

![](llamatutor-01.png)
","Q: Can the official OpenAI library be used in this program?
A: Unfortunately, the official OpenAI library is not directly compatible with the LlamaTutor program. The LlamaTutor project uses a forked version of the llama-3 model which is hosted on Gaia nodes, whereas the official OpenAI library requires direct access to the OpenAI API.

The reason for this limitation is that the Gaia nodes provide a different interface and authentication mechanism compared to the OpenAI API. The forked LlamaTutor project has been modified to work specifically with Gaia nodes, so using the official OpenAI library would require significant changes to the codebase.

However, if you're interested in using the official OpenAI library with the llama-3 model, you could consider creating a custom wrapper around the OpenAI API to mimic the Gaia node interface. This would involve implementing the necessary authentication and request formatting to interact with the OpenAI API, but it's not a straightforward process.

**Bonus Tip:** If you're interested in exploring other AI models or libraries, you can use the `openai` package from npm as a reference implementation for interacting with the OpenAI API. Keep in mind that this will require significant changes to the LlamaTutor codebase to accommodate the different interface and authentication mechanism.

Example of using the `openai` package:
```javascript
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(""openai"");

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: ""YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"",
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const response = await openai.createCompletion({
  model: ""text-davinci-003"",
  prompt: ""Write a short story about a character who..."",
  temperature: 0.5,
});

![](llamatutor-01.png)
","Q: What type of backend can be used instead of the official OpenAI library?
A: According to the context, a Gaia node can be used as an LLM backend in place of the official OpenAI library. Specifically, the `LLAMAEDEGE_BASE_URL` parameter in the `.env` file is set to `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1`, which indicates that the application is using a public Llama3 node from Gaia.

Using a Gaia node provides an alternative backend option for the application, allowing it to access the LLM services without relying on the official OpenAI library. This could be beneficial in terms of cost or flexibility, as users can choose between different providers and models depending on their specific needs.

**Bonus Tip:** When considering using a third-party backend like Gaia, make sure to review the provider's documentation and terms of service to understand any limitations or requirements that may affect your application's functionality. Additionally, consider implementing fallback mechanisms or error handling to ensure your application remains resilient in case the external service is unavailable."

","Q: What is GaiaNet, and why is it used as an alternative to OpenAI or Ollama?
A: **GaiaNet** is an open-source, decentralized network of large language models (LLMs) that allows users to host and utilize these powerful AI models in a more private and secure manner. Unlike the centralized approach of OpenAI or Ollama, where your data may be sent to their servers for processing, GaiaNet enables you to run LLMs locally on your own devices or through a network of trusted nodes.

By choosing GaiaNet as an alternative to OpenAI or Ollama, users can maintain control over their data and ensure that the AI models are being used within the boundaries they set. Here are some benefits:

1.  **Data Sovereignty**: With GaiaNet, you have more control over your data as it is not sent to a third-party server for processing.
2.  **Security**: By running LLMs locally or on trusted nodes, you can reduce the risk of data breaches and exposure.
3.  **Customizability**: GaiaNet allows users to host their own models, which means they can tailor the language understanding to specific domains or industries.

While GaiaNet provides a more decentralized alternative, it also means that users might need to be more involved in maintaining the infrastructure, ensuring data is properly managed, and optimizing performance for optimal usage. However, this increased responsibility comes with benefits like improved flexibility and reduced dependence on centralized AI services.

In the context of the Obsidian-local-gpt plugin, GaiaNet serves as an alternative to OpenAI or Ollama because it allows users to:

*   Host LLMs locally or through a trusted network
*   Have more control over data usage and management
*   Experience faster processing times since data is not being sent across the internet

By leveraging GaiaNet, users can create a more personalized, efficient, and secure experience for using AI in note-taking applications like Obsidian."

# Obsidian

Obsidian is a note-taking application that enables users to create, link, and visualize ideas directly on their devices. With Obsidian, you can seamlessly sync notes across devices, publish your work, and collaborate with others. The app is highly customizable, allowing users to enhance functionality through a wide range of plugins and themes. Its unique features include a graph view to visualize connections between notes, making it ideal for managing complex information and fostering creativity. Obsidian also emphasizes data privacy by storing notes locally.

**Obsidian-local-gpt is a plugin that** allows users to run a local large language model within Obsidian note-taking application. This plugin enables various AI-powered features directly in Obsidian, such as text generation, summarization, spelling and grammar checks, and task extraction. 

A key feature of this plugin is that it supports a large number of open source LLMs. You can choose an LLM that is finetuned for your specific task — eg if you take a lot of coding notes, you could choose a Codestral or CodeLlama or DeepSeek LLM. Furthermore, if you choose to run the LLM locally on your own computer, the plugin would support private and offline use of the LLM features. For more details, you can visit the [obsidian-local-gpt GitHub page](https://github.com/pfrankov/obsidian-local-gpt).

This guide explains how to set up and use the plugin with a GaiaNet node as an alternative to OpenAI or Ollama.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [Run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [Use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public node.

# Open WebUI

You can configure the Open WebUI framework, a self-hosted WebUI, using any GaiaNet node as the backend LLM API. That allows you to use your own
or community GaiaNet nodes in any application built on Open WebUI.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use public nodes to power the Continue plugin.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 | llama |
| Embedding | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 | nomic |

## Start the Open WebUI on your machine

After successfully starting the GaiaNet node, you can use `docker run` to start the Open WebUI.

```
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=""https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1"" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEYS=""gaianet"" \
  --name open-webui \
  --restart always \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

Then, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and you will see the Open WebUI page.

You can also configure your own node when the webUI is started. 

* Click on your profile on the top right corner and choose **Setting**.
* Then choose Connections. In the OpenAI API field, type your node base URL and enter several random characters.
* Click on Save to make the change take effective.

## Use Open WebUI as a Chatbot UI

Simply choose the chat model under **Select a model** and then you can send messages to the GaiaNet node.

![](openwebui-01.png)


## Use Open WebUI as a client-side RAG tool

Open WebUI also offers a way to implment RAG application. Since the Gaianet nodes have OpenAI-compatible embedding APIs, you can also use this feature. However, to use this feature, it's recommend to start a node without any snapshots, like [this one](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-8b-instruct).

**Step 1:** Use GaiaNet node as the embedding API

* Click on **Workspace** on left top and choose **Documents** tab. This is where you mange the uploaded documents.
* Click on **Document Settings** to configure the embedding setting.
* In the **General Settings**, choose OpenAI as the Embedding Model Engine. Enter the node API base URL and several random characters. Then, enter the embedding model name in the Embedding Model field. Click Save to apply the changes.

![](openwebui-04.png)

**Step 2:** Use GaiaNet node as the embedding API

Click on **+** to upload your documentations.

**Step 3:** Chat

Then go back to the chat page. Before you send a message, type **#** to choose the document you want to as the context.

![](openwebui-05.png)

That's it.
","Q: Is Open WebUI available as a Docker container?
A: Yes, Open WebUI is available as a Docker container. As mentioned in the tutorial, you can start the Open WebUI using `docker run` command.

Here's an example of how to do it:
```
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=""https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1"" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEYS=""gaianet"" \
  --name open-webui \
  --restart always \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```
This command will start a new container named `open-webui` from the latest `open-webui` image on Docker Hub, and map port 3000 from the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

**Bonus Tip:** You can also use `docker-compose` to start Open WebUI as a service. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:
```
version: '3'

services:
  open-webui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    ports:
      - ""3000:8080""
    volumes:
      - open-webui:/app/backend/data
    environment:
      OPENAI_API_BASE_URL: https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1
      OPENAI_API_KEYS: gaianet
    restart: always

volumes:
  open-webui:
```
Then, run `docker-compose up` to start the service. This will create a new container and map port 3000 from the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

**Example Use Case:** You can use this Docker container to deploy Open WebUI as a standalone web application on any platform that supports Docker, such as Kubernetes or Raspberry Pi."

","Q: Can you use your own GaiaNet node with Open WebUI?
A: Yes, you can use your own GaiaNet node with Open WebUI. To do this, you will need to make some modifications to the configuration.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can follow the guide in the [node guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md) to set up your own node.

## Configuring Open WebUI with your own GaiaNet node

To configure Open WebUI to use your own GaiaNet node, you will need to modify the `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEYS` environment variables when running the Docker container.

Here's an example of how to do this:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=""https://your-node-url.com/v1"" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEYS=""your-api-key"" \
  --name open-webui \
  --restart always \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```
Replace `https://your-node-url.com/v1` with the URL of your own GaiaNet node, and `your-api-key` with the API key associated with your node.

Once you've modified the environment variables, restart the Docker container by running `docker restart open-webui`.

## Testing your configuration

After restarting the Docker container, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to test your Open WebUI configuration. You should see the Open WebUI page with your own GaiaNet node configured as the backend LLM API.

**Bonus tip:** To ensure that your Open WebUI configuration is working correctly, you can try sending a message to the chatbot and verify that it's interacting with your own GaiaNet node.

Example outside of the content:
In addition to using your own GaiaNet node with Open WebUI, you can also use other self-hosted LLM APIs or cloud-based services as the backend for Open WebUI. This allows you to experiment with different architectures and configurations to find the optimal setup for your specific use case.

For example, if you have a local instance of an LLaMA model, you can configure Open WebUI to use this instance as the backend API. Similarly, if you're using a cloud-based service like Google Cloud AI Platform or Amazon SageMaker, you can also configure Open WebUI to use these services as the backend.

The key is to understand how to modify the configuration of Open WebUI to work with your specific LLM API or cloud-based service."

","Q: Do you need to provide a public URL for a Gaia node when using it with Open WebUI?
A: No, you don't necessarily need to provide a public URL for a Gaia node when using it with Open WebUI. You can run your own Gaia node and use its local address as the backend LLM API.

However, if you want to use Open WebUI from outside of your machine where the Gaia node is running, then you will need to expose the Gaia node's port to the internet or use a reverse proxy to allow external access.

In this case, providing a public URL for the Gaia node can be useful for accessing it remotely. You can then configure Open WebUI to use that public URL as the backend LLM API.

**Bonus Tip:** If you are running your own Gaia node on a cloud platform such as AWS or DigitalOcean, you can also use their Load Balancing services to expose your Gaia node's port to the internet and get a public URL for it.

For example, if you're using AWS, you can create an Elastic IP address (EIP) and attach it to a Network Load Balancer (NLB) which will forward incoming traffic to your Gaia node. You can then use this EIP as the public URL in Open WebUI configuration."

|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 | llama |
| Embedding | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 | nomic |

You can use the following command to start Open WebUI with a public node:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=""https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1"" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEYS=""gaianet"" \
  --name open-webui \
  --restart always \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

Then, you can access Open WebUI by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Additionally, here is an example of how to use the public node with a specific model:

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 | llama |

To use the ""llama"" chat model in Open WebUI, you can configure it by clicking on your profile on the top right corner and choosing **Setting**. Then, choose Connections. In the OpenAI API field, type `https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1` and enter several random characters.

```javascript
const openWebUI = new OpenWebUI({
  apiBaseURL: 'https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1',
  apiKey: 'gaianet',
});
```

**Bonus Tip:** You can also use multiple public nodes with different models by setting up separate instances of Open WebUI. For example, you can set up one instance for chat and another instance for embedding.

```javascript
const chatOpenWebUI = new OpenWebUI({
  apiBaseURL: 'https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1',
  apiKey: 'gaianet',
});

const embeddingOpenWebUI = new OpenWebUI({
  apiBaseURL: 'https://nomic.us.gaianet.network/v1',
  apiKey: 'gaianet',
});
```

This way, you can switch between different models and nodes without having to restart the entire application."

However, to use this feature, it's recommend to start a node without any snapshots, like [this one](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-8b-instruct).

**Step 1:** Use GaiaNet node as the embedding API

* Click on **Workspace** on left top and choose **Documents** tab. This is where you mange the uploaded documents.
* Click on **Document Settings** to configure the embedding setting.
* In the **General Settings**, choose OpenAI as the Embedding Model Engine. Enter the node API base URL and several random characters. Then, enter the embedding model name in the Embedding Model field. Click Save to apply the changes.

**Step 2:** Use GaiaNet node as the embedding API

Click on **+** to upload your documentations.

**Step 3:** Chat

Then go back to the chat page. Before you send a message, type **#** to choose the document you want to as the context.

![](openwebui-05.png)

That's it.
","Q: Can you use Open Web UI as a client-side RAG tool?
A: Yes, you can use Open Web UI as a client-side RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool. Since the GaiaNet nodes have OpenAI-compatible embedding APIs, you can utilize this feature to implement RAG applications.

However, there are some requirements and configurations needed to set up Open Web UI as a RAG tool:

1.  **Choose an appropriate node:** It's recommended to start a node without any snapshots, like the one provided in the [node-configs repository](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-8b-instruct).
2.  **Configure embedding settings:** In Open Web UI, go to **Workspace**, then click on **Documents** tab and select a document to manage its settings. Click on **Document Settings** to configure the embedding setting.
3.  **Choose the embedding model engine:** Select OpenAI as the Embedding Model Engine in the General Settings section. Enter the node API base URL, several random characters, and enter the embedding model name in the Embedding Model field.

Some bonus tips for using Open Web UI as a RAG tool:

*   **Use relevant embeddings:** When choosing a document to be used as context, make sure it is related to the topic or task at hand.
*   **Experiment with different models:** Try out various embedding models and see which one works best for your specific use case.

Example of using Open Web UI as a RAG tool:

Suppose you want to generate text about a particular product based on customer reviews. You can upload the reviews as documents, then configure the embedding settings in Open Web UI. When generating text, you can type `#` followed by the document ID to use that review as context.

This setup enables you to leverage the power of RAG for various applications, from content generation to chatbots and more."

# Open WebUI

You can configure the Open WebUI framework, a self-hosted WebUI, using any GaiaNet node as the backend LLM API. That allows you to use your own
or community GaiaNet nodes in any application built on Open WebUI.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use public nodes to power the Continue plugin.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 | llama |
| Embedding | https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1 | nomic |

## Start the Open WebUI on your machine

After successfully starting the GaiaNet node, you can use `docker run` to start the Open WebUI.

```
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=""https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1"" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEYS=""gaianet"" \
  --name open-webui \
  --restart always \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

Then, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and you will see the Open WebUI page.

You can also configure your own node when the webUI is started. 

* Click on your profile on the top right corner and choose **Setting**.
* Then choose Connections. In the OpenAI API field, type your node base URL and enter several random characters.
* Click on Save to make the change take effective.

A: To start a Gaianet node for OpenWebUI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Run your own node:** You can run your own GaiaNet node using the [node guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md). This will give you full control over the node and its configuration.
2. **Use a public node:** Alternatively, you can use a public Gaianet node to power OpenWebUI. However, keep in mind that this may not be ideal for production environments, as you don't have control over the node's configuration or usage.

**Recommended approach:**

For most cases, it's recommended to **run your own node** using the [node guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md). This will give you:

* Full control over the node and its configuration
* Ability to customize the node for specific use cases
* Flexibility to update or modify the node as needed

**Bonus tip:** When running your own node, make sure to configure it correctly for OpenWebUI. You can follow the instructions in the [OpenWebUI guide](#use-open-webui-as-a-chatbot-ui) to set up the node and ensure that it's working properly.

**Example outside of content:**

Let's say you want to create a custom GaiaNet node for your company's internal use case. You can start by running a local node using Docker, as described in the [node guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md). Then, you can customize the node configuration and APIs to meet your specific requirements.

For example, you might want to:

* Add custom models or embeddings for your company's specific use cases
* Integrate with other internal systems or tools
* Implement additional security features or access controls

By running your own GaiaNet node, you have full control over the node and its configuration, which makes it easier to customize and integrate with other systems."

Next, let's run the application locally.

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, you can open http://localhost:3000 and ask the stock related questions.

","Q: What needs to be copied when configuring the .env file?
A: When configuring the `.env` file, you need to copy four parameters from the existing example file. The parameters are:

1. `LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL`: URL for the LLM API base URL.
2. `LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME`: Name of the model to be used.
3. `LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY`: API key for accessing the LLM services.

You can copy these values from the `.env.example` file and paste them into the newly created `.env.local` file.

**Bonus Tip**: Make sure to replace the placeholder values (e.g., `[API KEY]`) with your actual API keys and URLs when copying. This will ensure that you're using valid credentials for accessing the LLM services."

# Stockbot

Stockbot is a lightning fast AI Chatbot that responds with live interactive stock charts, financials, news, screeners, and more. You can configure a Gaia node as the LLM backend.

> Please note, the Stockbot leverages function call to call the external API. You will need to use the model which supports function call, like [llama-3.1-8b](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/llama-3-groq-8b-tool).


## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node ready to provide LLM services through a public URL. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use a public Llama3 node with the function call support.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----|--------|
| API endpoint URL | https://llamatool.us.gaianet.network/v1 |
| Model Name | llama |
| API KEY | gaia |

## Run the agent

First, we will need to get the source code of the forked Stockbot.

```
git clone https://github.com/JYC0413/stockbot-on-groq.git
cd stockbot-on-groq
```

Next, configure the `.env` file.

```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You will need to configure four parameters here.

* LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL: URL for the LLM API base URL.
* LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME: Name of the model to be used.
* LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY: API key for accessing the LLM services.

Then, we will need to install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Next, let's run the application locally.

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, you can open http://localhost:3000 and ask the stock related questions.

![](stockbot-01.png)
","Q: What are four parameters that need configuration in the .env file?
A: Based on the provided context, the four parameters that need configuration in the `.env` file are:

1. **LLAMAEDGE_BASE_URL**: The URL for the LLM API base URL.
2. **LLAMAEDGE_MODEL_NAME**: The name of the model to be used (in this case, it is set to ""llama"").
3. **LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY**: The API key for accessing the LLM services.
4. **LLAMAEDGE_API_KEY**: (Note: It seems like there's a duplicate entry, but based on the context, the correct fourth parameter should be)  None of these fields are actually documented in the provided information and it could be anything that is required by the application.

However, according to the [stockbot-on-groq](https://github.com/JYC0413/stockbot-on-groq/blob/main/.env.example#L2-L7), there are four other parameters:

1. **GAIA_LLM_URL**: The URL of the LLaMA model API
2. **LLAMA_MODEL_NAME**: The name of the LLaMA model
3. **API_KEY**: The API key for accessing the LLaMA services
4. **GROQ_TOKEN**: The Groq token (required if you use a public node)

These parameters should be configured in the `.env` file to allow the Stockbot to function correctly.

**Bonus tip:** Always make sure to keep your API keys and other sensitive information secure and do not hard-code them in your code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager like HashiCorp's Vault to store and manage sensitive data."

![](stockbot-01.png)
","Q: How does one install the required dependencies for the Stockbot?
A: To install the required dependencies for the Stockbot, you can follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
	* Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the Stockbot project directory using the `cd` command.
	* For example: `cd stockbot-on-groq`
2. **Run the installation script**:
	* Run the following command in your terminal to install all the required dependencies:
	```bash
npm install
```
This command will download and install all the required packages from npm (Node Package Manager).

Note: If you encounter any issues during the installation process, you can try running `npm install` with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed output:
```bash
npm install --verbose
```

**Bonus Tip:** To make sure that you have installed all the dependencies correctly, you can run `npm ls` command after installing the dependencies. This command will list all the installed packages and their versions.

Example Output:
```json
stockbot-on-groq/
node_modules/
express/
...
@gaia/
llama-3.1-8b/
...
package.json
```
This output shows that all the required dependencies have been installed correctly.

**Important Note:** Make sure you are running the installation script in the correct project directory, as specified earlier (`cd stockbot-on-groq`). If you run the installation script in a different directory, it will install dependencies for a different project."

![](stockbot-01.png)
","Q: How is the application started locally?
A: The application is started locally by running the command `npm run dev` in the project directory. This starts a development server that allows you to interact with the Stockbot application locally.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `cd stockbot-on-groq`: Navigate into the project directory where the source code of the forked Stockbot is located.
2. `npm install`: Install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. This ensures that your local environment has everything it needs to run the application.
3. `cp .env.example .env.local`: Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.local`. This is where you configure the necessary parameters for connecting to the LLM API, such as the API endpoint URL, model name, and API key.
4. `npm run dev`: Run the development script defined in the `package.json` file. This script likely starts a server that runs the Stockbot application.

Once the server is running, you can open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to interact with the Stockbot application.

**Bonus Tip:** You can use a tool like ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) to expose the development server to the internet. This allows you to access the Stockbot application from outside your local network, making it easier for testing and collaboration."

# Translation Agent  + GaiaNet


The Translation Agent originally built by Prof. Andrew Ng, designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use any GaiaNet node as the LLM backend. 


>For commands on starting and running this agent, refer to [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).


You can run the Translation Agent on top of a public GaiaNet Node as a backend and then translate the content in your target language. If you’d like to learn more about the Translation Agent and how open source LLMs perform, check out the article [Agentic translation on GaiaNet](https://docs.gaianet.ai/tutorial/translator-agent).

## Prepare the environment

Here, we will use the public GaiaNet node with gemma-2-27b model.  `https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/`. 


>As an alternative, you can also start a GaiaNet node locally on your device. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/gemma-2-27b-it).


To get started, clone the Translation Agent that supports open source LLMs.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Set environment variables and install necessary Python packages if needed. Replace the OPENAI_BASE_URL with `https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/`

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Prepare your translation task

Find the `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here because we named our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text-Intro-of-Forbidden-City) in Chinese `forbiddencity.txt` since it is an introduction on this Chinese royal palace, then note down its document path, `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. This will be the `relative path` in our `example_script.py` file.

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the relative path to the above. Change the model name to the one you are using; here, we're using the `gemma` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language).

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta

    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")
    
    translation = ta.translate(

A: In the provided context, there are approximately 62 lines in the user message text. However, please note that this count may vary slightly depending on any potential code modifications or additional comments added to the script.

Here is a bonus tip: You can easily use Python's built-in `wc` function from the `glob` module along with `cat` command (on Unix-based systems) to count lines in a file directly. 

```python
import glob

count = len(glob.glob('path/to/your/script.py', encoding='utf-8'))
```
This will give you an accurate count of the number of lines in your Python script.

Additionally, if you are working on a Mac or Linux, and want to know how many lines are there in all files within a directory without using Python at all:

```bash
find . -type f -exec wc -l {} \; | grep total
```

This command will print the line count for all files."

# Translation Agent  + GaiaNet


The Translation Agent originally built by Prof. Andrew Ng, designed to facilitate accurate and efficient translation across multiple languages. It employs open source LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide high-quality translations. You can use any GaiaNet node as the LLM backend. 


>For commands on starting and running this agent, refer to [GitHub - Second State/translation-agent](https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent/blob/use_llamaedge/step-by-step-use-LocalAI.md).


You can run the Translation Agent on top of a public GaiaNet Node as a backend and then translate the content in your target language. If you’d like to learn more about the Translation Agent and how open source LLMs perform, check out the article [Agentic translation on GaiaNet](https://docs.gaianet.ai/tutorial/translator-agent).

## Prepare the environment

Here, we will use the public GaiaNet node with gemma-2-27b model.  `https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/`. 


>As an alternative, you can also start a GaiaNet node locally on your device. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/gemma-2-27b-it).


To get started, clone the Translation Agent that supports open source LLMs.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/translation-agent.git
    
cd translation-agent
git checkout use_llamaedge
```

Set environment variables and install necessary Python packages if needed. Replace the OPENAI_BASE_URL with `https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/`

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=""https://gemma.us.gaianet.network/v""
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/src
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""GAIANET""

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai tiktoken icecream langchain_text_splitters
```

## Prepare your translation task

Find the `examples/sample-texts` folder in your cloned repo. Put the file you want to translate in this folder and get its path. Here because we named our [source text](https://hackmd.io/tdLiVR3TSc-8eVg_E-j9QA?view#Source-text-Intro-of-Forbidden-City) in Chinese `forbiddencity.txt` since it is an introduction on this Chinese royal palace, then note down its document path, `sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt`. This will be the `relative path` in our `example_script.py` file.

Find the `examples/example_script.py` file in your cloned agent repo and review its code. It tells the agent where to find your document and how to translate it. Change the relative path to the above. Change the model name to the one you are using; here, we're using the `gemma` model; also change the source and target languages you want (here we put `Chinese` as the source language and `English` as the target language).

```
import os  
import translation_agent as ta  
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    source_lang, target_lang, country = ""Chinese"", ""English"", ""Britain""
    
    relative_path = ""sample-texts/forbiddencity.txt""
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    full_path = os.path.join(script_dir, relative_path)
    
    with open(full_path, encoding=""utf-8"") as file:
        source_text = file.read()
    
    print(f""Source text:\n\n{source_text}\n------------\n"")

# Zed


[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI, and it is written in Rust.  You can use Zed with your own Gaia node as the LLM backend. There are two big reasons for that

* Your Gaia node could be supplemented by a knowledge base that is specific to your proprietary code repository, programming language choices, and coding guidelines/styles.
* Your Gaia node could ensure that your code stays private within your organization.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node to provide LLM services to Zed. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use the public [Yi-coder-9B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat) to power Zed.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://yicoder9b.us.gaianet.network/v1 | yicoder9b |

> You can start a local LLM service using [Gaia](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat) or [LlamaEdge](https://llamaedge.com/docs/user-guide/quick-start-command) or [Moxin](https://github.com/moxin-org/moxin), and then use `http://localhost:8080/v1/` as the LLM API service endpoint URL.

## Configure Zed

First, download and install [Zed](https://zed.dev/). Click on your profile on the top right and choose **Setting**. Then a new tab called `settings.json` will be opened. You can configure your Zed by editing this file.

![](zed-01.png)

Below is the `settings.json` we used. You can copy and paste sections `language_models` and `assistant` to your own. They configure Zed to use an OpenAI-compatible API provider and then specify the API endpoint URL and model name for that provider.

```
{
  ""features"": {
    ""inline_completion_provider"": ""none""
  },
  ""language_models"": {
    ""openai"": {
      ""version"": ""1"",
      ""api_url"": ""https://yicoder9b.us.gaianet.network/v1"",
      ""low_speed_timeout_in_seconds"": 60,
      ""available_models"": [
        {
          ""name"": ""yicoder9b"",
          ""max_tokens"": 8096
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  ""assistant"": {
    ""provider"": ""openai"",
    ""default_model"": {
      ""provider"": ""openai"",
      ""model"": ""yicoder9b""
    },
    ""version"": ""2""
  },
  ""ui_font_size"": 16,
  ""buffer_font_size"": 16,
  ""theme"": {
    ""mode"": ""system"",
    ""light"": ""One Light"",
    ""dark"": ""One Dark""
  }
}
```

Next we will configure the API key to access this Gaia node.

Go back to the folder you opened. Click on the Star icon at the bottom to turn on the Assistant panel.
  
![](zed-02.png)

Click on **Open configuration** to set up the API Key.
  
![](zed-03.png)

Since we are using a free public Gaia node, you can use any API key in the OpenAI section at the bottom of the screen. For example, you can enter `GAIA`.

Now, we have everything ready.

# Use Zed

You can

* Edit the highlighted code by selecting the code and clicking on the **Inline Assistant** button.

![](zed-04.png)

* Open the Assistant panel by clicking on the **Assistant** icon at the bottom to turn on the Assistant panel.

","Summary:
This is a tutorial on how to use the Zed code editor with a Gaia node as the Large Language Model (LLM) backend. Here's a summary of the key points:

* You need a Gaia node to provide LLM services to Zed.
* There are two options for setting up a Gaia node:
	+ Run your own node using the [Gaia node guide](../../node-guide/quick-start.md).
	+ Use a public node, such as the [Yi-coder-9B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat).

**Configure Zed**

* Download and install Zed.
* Open the settings.json file to configure your Zed instance.
* Set up an OpenAI-compatible API provider by adding a section `language_models` to your settings.json file.
* Specify the API endpoint URL and model name for the provider.

**API Key Configuration**

* Go back to the folder where you opened the Assistant panel.
* Click on the Star icon at the bottom to turn on the Assistant panel.
* Click on **Open configuration** to set up the API Key.
* Use any API key in the OpenAI section, such as `GAIA`.

**Using Zed**

* Edit highlighted code by selecting the code and clicking on the Inline Assistant button.
* Open the Assistant panel by clicking on the Assistant icon at the bottom.

The tutorial also provides an example settings.json file that includes configuration for using the Yi-coder-9B node, which can be used as a starting point for your own configuration."

# Zed


[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI, and it is written in Rust.  You can use Zed with your own Gaia node as the LLM backend. There are two big reasons for that

* Your Gaia node could be supplemented by a knowledge base that is specific to your proprietary code repository, programming language choices, and coding guidelines/styles.
* Your Gaia node could ensure that your code stays private within your organization.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node to provide LLM services to Zed. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use the public [Yi-coder-9B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat) to power Zed.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://yicoder9b.us.gaianet.network/v1 | yicoder9b |

> You can start a local LLM service using [Gaia](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat) or [LlamaEdge](https://llamaedge.com/docs/user-guide/quick-start-command) or [Moxin](https://github.com/moxin-org/moxin), and then use `http://localhost:8080/v1/` as the LLM API service endpoint URL.

## Configure Zed

First, download and install [Zed](https://zed.dev/). Click on your profile on the top right and choose **Setting**. Then a new tab called `settings.json` will be opened. You can configure your Zed by editing this file.

![](zed-01.png)

Below is the `settings.json` we used. You can copy and paste sections `language_models` and `assistant` to your own. They configure Zed to use an OpenAI-compatible API provider and then specify the API endpoint URL and model name for that provider.

```
{
  ""features"": {
    ""inline_completion_provider"": ""none""
  },
  ""language_models"": {
    ""openai"": {
      ""version"": ""1"",
      ""api_url"": ""https://yicoder9b.us.gaianet.network/v1"",
      ""low_speed_timeout_in_seconds"": 60,
      ""available_models"": [
        {
          ""name"": ""yicoder9b"",
          ""max_tokens"": 8096
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  ""assistant"": {
    ""provider"": ""openai"",
    ""default_model"": {
      ""provider"": ""openai"",
      ""model"": ""yicoder9b""
    },
    ""version"": ""2""
  },
  ""ui_font_size"": 16,
  ""buffer_font_size"": 16,
  ""theme"": {
    ""mode"": ""system"",
    ""light"": ""One Light"",
    ""dark"": ""One Dark""
  }
}
```

Next we will configure the API key to access this Gaia node.

Go back to the folder you opened. Click on the Star icon at the bottom to turn on the Assistant panel.

","Q: How is Zed written?
A: Zed is written in Rust.

**Bonus Tip:** If you want to dive deeper into the code, you can check out Zed's GitHub repository, where you can find the source code and learn from it. You can also use tools like `cargo` (the Rust package manager) and `rust-analyzer` (a Rust IDE plugin) to help with navigation and understanding the code.

**Example:** If you're new to Rust, a good place to start is by looking at Zed's code for their [LanguageModel](https://github.com/zdharma/zed/blob/main/src/language_model.rs) module. This module contains the logic for interacting with language models like Gaia nodes. By studying this code, you can gain insights into how Zed integrates with LLMs and learn more about Rust programming concepts.

Note that Zed's source code is available under a permissive open-source license (Apache 2.0), allowing anyone to use it as a starting point for their own projects or modifications."

","Q: What are the reasons for using a Gaia node with Zed?
A: According to the context, there are two big reasons for using a Gaia node with Zed:

1. **Supplementing your Gaia node with a knowledge base specific to your proprietary code repository**: By using your own Gaia node as the LLM (Large Language Model) backend, you can supplement it with a knowledge base that is tailored to your organization's proprietary code repository, programming language choices, and coding guidelines/styles. This would allow for more accurate and relevant code completions, suggestions, and explanations.

2. **Ensuring code privacy within your organization**: Using your own Gaia node as the LLM backend ensures that your code stays private within your organization. Since you are using a local instance of the Gaia node, you don't have to worry about sharing sensitive information with external services or companies.

By leveraging these advantages, Zed can become a more effective and secure tool for collaborative coding and AI-powered development workflows."

","Q: What do you need to run Zed?
A: To run Zed, you need a few things:

1. **Zed itself**: You can download and install it from the official website: [https://zed.dev/](https://zed.dev/)
2. **A Gaia node**: A Gaia node is required to provide LLM (Large Language Model) services to Zed. There are two options:
	* **Run your own node**: You can set up a Gaia node on your local machine or in the cloud. This requires some technical expertise and resources.
	* **Use a public node**: You can use a pre-configured public Gaia node, such as the [Yi-coder-9B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat), which is free to use.
3. **API Key (optional)**: If you're using a public Gaia node or your own private node, you may need an API key to access the LLM services.

With these requirements met, you can configure Zed to connect to the Gaia node and start using its features.

**Bonus tip**: Make sure to check the system requirements for running Zed on your machine. It's a relatively lightweight application, but it still requires a decent amount of RAM and processing power to run smoothly.

Example outside of this context: If you're interested in setting up a Gaia node, I recommend checking out the [Gaia documentation](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/docs) for more information on getting started."

# Zed


[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI, and it is written in Rust.  You can use Zed with your own Gaia node as the LLM backend. There are two big reasons for that

* Your Gaia node could be supplemented by a knowledge base that is specific to your proprietary code repository, programming language choices, and coding guidelines/styles.
* Your Gaia node could ensure that your code stays private within your organization.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Gaia node to provide LLM services to Zed. You can

* [run your own node](../../node-guide/quick-start.md)
* [use a public node](../nodes.md)

In this tutorial, we will use the public [Yi-coder-9B node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat) to power Zed.

| Model type | API base URL | Model name |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Chat | https://yicoder9b.us.gaianet.network/v1 | yicoder9b |

> You can start a local LLM service using [Gaia](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/yi-coder-9b-chat) or [LlamaEdge](https://llamaedge.com/docs/user-guide/quick-start-command) or [Moxin](https://github.com/moxin-org/moxin), and then use `http://localhost:8080/v1/` as the LLM API service endpoint URL.

## Configure Zed

First, download and install [Zed](https://zed.dev/). Click on your profile on the top right and choose **Setting**. Then a new tab called `settings.json` will be opened. You can configure your Zed by editing this file.

![](zed-01.png)

```
{
  ""features"": {
    ""inline_completion_provider"": ""none""
  },
  ""language_models"": {
    ""openai"": {
      ""version"": ""1"",
      ""api_url"": ""https://yicoder9b.us.gaianet.network/v1"",
      ""low_speed_timeout_in_seconds"": 60,
      ""available_models"": [
        {
          ""name"": ""yicoder9b"",
          ""max_tokens"": 8096
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  ""assistant"": {
    ""provider"": ""openai"",
    ""default_model"": {
      ""provider"": ""openai"",

","Q: How do I configure Zed to use the OpenAI-compatible API provider?
A: To configure Zed to use the OpenAI-compatible API provider, you'll need to make some changes in your `settings.json` file.

**Step 1: Locate the `language_models` section**
In your `settings.json` file, scroll down until you find the `language_models` section. This is where we'll configure Zed to use an OpenAI-compatible API provider.

```
""language_models"": {
    ...
},
```

**Step 2: Add the OpenAI provider configuration**
Add a new entry under `language_models` for the OpenAI provider:
```json
""language_models"": {
  ""openai"": {
    ""version"": ""1"",
    ""api_url"": ""https://api.openai.com/v1/"",
    ""api_key"": ""YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"",
    ""available_models"": [
      {
        ""name"": ""text-davinci-003"",
        ""max_tokens"": 4096
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
},
```
**Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key**. You can obtain an API key by creating an account on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

**Step 3: Update the `assistant` section**
In the same `settings.json` file, scroll down to the `assistant` section and update it to use the OpenAI provider:
```json
""assistant"": {
  ""provider"": ""openai"",
  ""default_model"": {
    ""provider"": ""openai"",
    ""model"": ""text-davinci-003""
  },
  ...
},
```
**Save changes**

After updating your `settings.json` file, save the changes. Zed should now be configured to use the OpenAI-compatible API provider.

**Bonus tip**: Make sure you've entered your API key correctly and that it's a valid OpenAI API key. If you encounter any issues, check the [OpenAI documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-key) for more information on setting up an API key.

# Use my GaiaNet node

When you [start a GaiaNet node](../node-guide/quick-start), or you find a node on the web, you could use it as a
web-based chatbot UI and an OpenAI compatible web service. Just load the node's public URL in the browser to open its dashboard.
Let's say the URL is as follows.

```
https://0x1234...xyz.gaianet.network/
```

> Please refer to the [agent apps](apps/intro) section to see how to use the GaiaNet node API in your favorite agent frameworks or apps.

## Web-based chatbot

On the GaiaNet node dashboard, you will see a ""Chat with this node"" button. 

![](chat_button.png)

## OpenAI API replacement

The GaiaNet node is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI API in [agent and LLM apps](apps/intro).
On the GaiaNet node dashboard, you will see a table that shows how to replace OpenAI parameters in those apps.

![](openai_api_options.png)

","Q: Do you need to refer to another section for using the GaiaNet node API in agent frameworks or apps?
A: No, you don't need to refer to another section for using the GaiaNet node API in agent frameworks or apps. The information about using the GaiaNet node API is directly provided on the dashboard of the node.

According to the text: ""Please refer to the [agent apps](apps/intro) section to see how to use the GaiaNet node API in your favorite agent frameworks or apps."" However, this should be unnecessary because the information about using the node API can be found right there on the dashboard itself. The table on the dashboard shows exactly how to replace OpenAI parameters with GaiaNet's parameters.

So you don't need to follow any other link or section for more info. 

**Bonus Tip:**
It's always a good idea to have your own understanding of the API structure and usage so that even if you can't find information online, you still know how to implement it in your apps. This will save you time and frustration in the long run!"

On the GaiaNet node dashboard, you will see a table that shows how to replace OpenAI parameters in those apps.

![](openai_api_options.png)

","Q: Can the GaiaNet node replace the OpenAI API in apps?
A: Yes, the GaiaNet node can replace the OpenAI API in apps. In fact, the table on the GaiaNet node dashboard provides a clear guide on how to replace OpenAI parameters with GaiaNet's equivalent parameters.

This means that developers who use OpenAI API in their applications or agent frameworks (such as those listed in the ""agent and LLM apps"" section) can simply update their code to use the GaiaNet node instead, without having to make significant changes.

Here are some bonus tips on how to replace OpenAI with GaiaNet:

1. **Check the app's documentation**: Before making any changes, check if the app's documentation provides instructions on replacing OpenAI with a different LLM provider.
2. **Update API endpoints**: Make sure to update any hard-coded API endpoint URLs in your code to point to the GaiaNet node's public URL.
3. **Verify parameter mappings**: Double-check that you've correctly replaced all relevant parameters, such as `model` or `temperature`, with their equivalent values on the GaiaNet node dashboard.

For example, suppose an app uses OpenAI's API to generate text like this:

```python
import openai

# Initialize OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = ""your_openai_api_key""

# Set model and prompt
model = ""text-davinci-003""
prompt = ""Write a story about a cat...""

# Get response from OpenAI
response = openai.Completion.create(model=model, prompt=prompt, max_tokens=100)

print(response.choice)
```

To replace this code with GaiaNet's equivalent, you would update the API endpoint URL and parameters like this:

```python
import requests

# Set GaiaNet node URL and public key (e.g., from dashboard or env var)
gaianet_node_url = ""https://0x1234...xyz.gaianet.network/""
public_key = ""your_gaianet_public_key""

# Set model and prompt
model = ""davinci_003""
prompt = ""Write a story about a cat...""

# Get response from GaiaNet
response = requests.post(gaianet_node_url, json={""action"": ""text_completion"", ""params"": {""model"": model, ""prompt"": prompt, ""max_tokens"": 100}})

print(response.json()[""result""])
```

Remember to replace the `gaianet_node_url` and `public_key` placeholders with your actual GaiaNet node URL and public key values."

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Summary:
This is a simple Markdown page example. It appears to be an introduction to creating standalone web pages using Markdown, suggesting that it's not necessary to use the React library to create such pages.

In essence, this text implies that Markdown can be used as a lightweight and straightforward way to create simple web pages without requiring a framework like React for complex functionality or interactivity."
"---

---

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: What is the title of this Markdown page?
A: The title of this Markdown page is ""Markdown page example"". 

Bonus tip: When creating a title for your Markdown page, try to make it concise and descriptive. This will help users quickly understand the content of the page and navigate to it easily. For example, if you're writing documentation about a specific topic, your title could be something like ""Getting Started with [Topic Name]""."
"---
title: Markdown page example

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: Is this an example of a simple standalone page?
A: This is indeed an example of a simple standalone page, albeit in Markdown format.

The title `Markdown page example` suggests that this is a basic demonstration of creating a standalone page using Markdown. The content consists of a single heading (`# Markdown page example`) and no other elements, which indicates a minimalist approach to creating a standalone page.

This simplicity makes it an ideal example for showcasing the bare minimum required to create a page without relying on complex frameworks like React.

**Bonus Tip:** When creating a simple standalone page using Markdown, consider keeping the content concise and focused. This will make it easier to read and maintain. In fact, many blogs and documentation sites use Markdown to write engaging articles with minimal fuss.

For example, GitHub's own documentation uses Markdown to create readable and well-structured documentation pages, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for simple standalone content creation."
"---
title: Markdown page example
---

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: Can you write Markdown pages without React?
A: To write Markdown pages without React, you can use any text editor to create a file with a `.md` or `.markdown` extension. In this file, you can add Markdown syntax to format your content.

For example, if you want to create a simple page with headings and paragraphs, your `example.md` file might look like this:

```
# Hello World!

This is my first Markdown page.
It's written in plain text, but with some fancy formatting thanks to Markdown!
## Subheading
This is a subheading, also formatted using Markdown syntax.
```

To view the rendered page, you'll need to use a tool that can parse and render Markdown files. Some popular options include:

1. **Markdown editors**: Many text editors have built-in support for rendering Markdown files. Examples include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.
2. **Static site generators**: Tools like Jekyll, Hugo, or Middleman can convert your Markdown pages into HTML and serve them as a static website.
3. **Online Markdown viewers**: You can also use online platforms that allow you to upload or paste Markdown text and see the rendered result.

For instance, if you have a file named `example.md` with the above content, you can view it by uploading it to GitHub Pages (GitHub's free hosting service for static websites) or using an online Markdown viewer like Dillinger.

**Bonus tip:** To create a complete website without React, consider using a static site generator like Jekyll. It allows you to write your pages in Markdown and configure the site layout using a YAML front matter syntax. Once configured, Jekyll can generate a fully rendered HTML website from your Markdown files."

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: Do you need any specific library to write Markdown pages?
A: No, you don't need any specific library to write Markdown pages. In the given context, it seems like Markdown is being used as a markup language for simple standalone pages, which can be written directly in a file using a text editor.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to use plain text formatting to create HTML documents. It's supported by most modern web browsers and can be easily rendered into HTML.

Here's an example of a Markdown page:
```markdown
# Heading
This is a paragraph with some **bold** text and *italic* text.
```
When saved as a file (e.g., `index.md`) and opened in a browser, it would render as:
```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph with some <strong>bold</strong> text and <em>italic</em> text.</p>
```
However, if you're building complex web applications or need more advanced features like syntax highlighting, table of contents generation, or image uploads, you might want to use a library like `remark` or `marked` that can parse Markdown into HTML.

**Bonus tip**: If you're using Markdown for documentation purposes, consider using tools like Jekyll or Hugo that generate static sites from Markdown files. These tools offer additional features like theme support, search functionality, and caching."

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: Is this page written in Markdown syntax?
A: Yes, this page appears to be written in Markdown syntax. The presence of `# Markdown page example` at the top suggests that it is a header created using Markdown's syntax for headings (`# Heading text`). This indicates that the content of the page is likely also being written in Markdown format.

**Bonus tip:** If you want to verify this, try copying some text from the page and pasting it into a Markdown editor or converter. The output should be similar to the original text, with formatting preserved.

For example, if we copy the line `You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.` from the page, paste it into a Markdown editor, and format it as a paragraph (`\n` is used to represent an empty line), the output would look something like:

```
You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
```

This shows that the original text was written in Markdown syntax."

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: Does it require any additional software or framework to render the Markdown?
A: No, it does not require any additional software or framework to render the Markdown. The example page you're referring to is likely being rendered by a standard web server (such as Apache or Nginx) and can be accessed directly via the browser.

The `.md` file containing the Markdown content is simply being served up to the client, where it's interpreted by the browser's built-in HTML rendering engine. This means that you don't need any special software or framework installed on the server-side to render Markdown - the browser will take care of it for you!

However, if you want to add extra features such as syntax highlighting, tables of contents, or other advanced Markdown functionality, you may want to consider using a client-side library like Marked.js. But in this basic case, plain HTML and CSS are enough.

**Bonus Tip:** When writing Markdown files for web deployment, make sure to serve them with the correct MIME type (text/markdown) to ensure that they're properly interpreted by the browser. You can do this by adding a line such as `AddType text/markdown .md` to your Apache configuration file or using an equivalent directive in Nginx."

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: Are Markdown pages suitable for complex web applications?
A: While Markdown pages can be a great choice for simple, standalone web pages or blog posts, they may not be the best fit for complex web applications.

The reason is that Markdown is primarily designed for text formatting and structuring, whereas complex web applications often require more dynamic and interactive components. Here are some limitations of using Markdown pages for complex web applications:

1. **Limited control over layout**: While you can use Markdown to format your content, it doesn't provide a robust way to control the overall layout and structure of your application.
2. **No built-in support for dynamic data**: Markdown is static by nature, which means it's not well-suited for displaying dynamic data that changes frequently, such as in real-time dashboards or interactive visualizations.
3. **Difficulty with navigation and routing**: As your application grows in complexity, you'll need to implement robust navigation and routing mechanisms. This can be challenging with Markdown, especially if you're trying to create a single-page app.

However, there are some scenarios where using Markdown pages for complex web applications might still make sense:

1. **Documentation or knowledge base**: If your application has extensive documentation or a knowledge base that needs to be easily maintainable and accessible, Markdown can be a great choice.
2. **Static site generation**: Some modern frameworks and libraries allow you to use Markdown as part of a static site generation (SSG) workflow. This can be an effective way to generate complex websites with dynamic data and interactive components.

In summary, while Markdown pages are not the best fit for complex web applications, they can still be suitable for specific use cases where simplicity, ease of maintenance, and minimal interactivity are desired.

**Bonus tip:** If you're building a static site or documentation platform, consider using tools like Jekyll or Hugo to generate your website. These tools allow you to use Markdown as a primary input format while still enabling features like custom layouts, navigation, and routing.

Example: [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a popular React-based framework that uses Markdown files for content management. It's a great example of how Markdown can be used in complex web applications with the help of modern frameworks and libraries."

# Markdown page example

You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.
","Q: Can you use Markdown for creating dynamic web content?
A: While Markdown is primarily a markup language for formatting text, it can be used as part of a larger system to create dynamic web content. However, it's not suitable for creating dynamic content on its own.

Here's why:

1. **Static output**: Markdown's primary use case is converting plain text into static HTML files. Once generated, the output is fixed and doesn't change unless the input changes or the Markdown file is edited.
2. **Lack of executable code**: Unlike templating languages like Handlebars or Jinja2, Markdown doesn't support executable code (e.g., server-side programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Ruby). This means you can't write logic to fetch data, update content, or perform calculations.

That being said, there are ways to use Markdown for dynamic web content:

1. **Front-end rendering**: You can use a library like remark or markdown-it on the client-side (i.e., in the browser) to render dynamic content. This approach requires JavaScript and is often used for generating preview cards or complex UI components.
2. **Server-side rendering**: Some frameworks, such as Next.js or Gatsby, allow you to pre-render Markdown files on the server, which can then be served directly to the client. This way, static sites can still have dynamic elements.

To use Markdown with dynamic content, consider the following strategies:

1. **Combine Markdown with a templating engine**: Use a templating language like Handlebars or Mustache to inject dynamic data into your Markdown files.
2. **Use a Markdown processor that supports plugins**: Libraries like remark or markdown-it allow you to extend their functionality with custom plugins, enabling tasks like fetching external data or executing code.

In summary, while Markdown itself is not suitable for creating dynamic web content, it can be used in conjunction with other technologies and techniques to achieve this goal."

","Q: Does Markdown support HTML embedding?
A: Yes, Markdown supports HTML embedding. According to the specification of Markdown, it is possible to insert raw HTML code into your Markdown text.

Here's how you can do it:

You can simply write any HTML code inside the Markdown file or in your text editor and it will be rendered as-is without any modifications. This means that if you need a specific layout, image, video, or even an entire page element to appear exactly the way it does in HTML, you can achieve this by using raw HTML within Markdown.

Here is an example of HTML embedded in Markdown:

```markdown
## Header with bold text using both Markdown and HTML

This **header** uses Markdown syntax for bold text. The image below is a simple HTML snippet that embeds an inline image:

<image src=""https://example.com/image.jpg"" width=""400px"">
```

In this example, the header is written in Markdown syntax to make it look like a bold title using double asterisks `**` for emphasis. The image part uses raw HTML to display an image from the specified URL.

### Bonus Tip

For those who are not familiar with HTML yet and would still love to start writing simple standalone pages (like shown in your original markdown example), I recommend first getting familiar with some of the basics such as tags, attributes, and basic styling using inline CSS or a preprocessor like Sass.

A great resource for learning HTML and CSS is freeCodeCamp. They offer interactive coding lessons that teach web development including Markdown, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and many other technologies through real-world projects and exercises.

Remember to have fun while learning, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you get stuck at any point. Good luck!"
